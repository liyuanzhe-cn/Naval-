# Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity, and Poverty

### Part I: The Puzzle of Nations

Why are some nations rich, and others poor? Why do some countries thrive, while others sink into chaos? Why do some societies invent, innovate, and grow, while others seem to stand still? This is the great puzzle of nations, a question that has haunted historians, economists, and philosophers for centuries. And it is the question at the heart of our journey today.  

When you run, your feet pound against the treadmill. Step after step, breath after breath, the rhythm builds. Some runners speed ahead, some stumble, some give up. Nations are the same. Some sprint forward with prosperity, others remain stuck, running in place, exhausted but unmoving. And some, despite bursts of speed, collapse before the finish line.  

Many people have tried to explain this difference. Some said geography explains it all. Hot climates breed laziness, cold climates breed discipline. Fertile soil creates wealth, deserts create poverty. Others said culture explains it. Some cultures are thrifty, hardworking, and destined for growth. Others are wasteful or corrupt, doomed to stagnation. Still others argued that leaders simply did not know better. They thought poverty came from ignorance, that poor nations just needed advice, experts, and aid.  

But these myths fail. Geography cannot explain why North Korea and South Korea, sharing the same peninsula, stand worlds apart in wealth. Culture cannot explain why once-proud empires like China or the Ottoman Empire fell behind, despite rich traditions and long histories. Ignorance cannot explain why leaders often know what policies would make their countries richer, yet choose not to follow them. Something deeper is at work.  

That deeper force is institutions. Institutions are the rules of the game. They shape who has power, who makes decisions, who enjoys rights, and who reaps rewards. Institutions decide whether people can start businesses freely, whether they can speak and invent without fear, whether their property is protected, whether opportunities are shared or monopolized.  

When institutions are inclusive, they open doors. They allow broad participation, fair rules, innovation, and mobility. Inclusive institutions create growth that spreads. When institutions are extractive, they close doors. They concentrate power in the hands of the few. They block competition, steal wealth, and silence new ideas. Extractive institutions kill growth.  

This is why nations fail. Not because of their soil, or their traditions, or their lack of knowledge. But because of their rules. Rules that empower, or rules that enslave. Rules that let people run free, or rules that chain them to the treadmill of poverty.  

Think of running itself. On a treadmill, you move but stay in place. Your body works, your sweat drips, but the ground never changes. That is the fate of extractive nations. Their people work, but their rulers take. Their farmers plant, but landlords seize. Their workers labor, but bosses exploit. Their citizens strive, but the system blocks their path. The result is effort without escape, motion without progress.  

In contrast, inclusive nations run forward. Every step moves them closer to prosperity. The treadmill is replaced by an open road, with milestones of growth along the way. Farmers keep the fruit of their labor, inventors profit from their creations, entrepreneurs compete fairly, citizens have a voice. The path may be steep, but the climb leads upward.  

This puzzle of nations is not only about history, or economics, or politics. It is about power. Who holds it, who shares it, and who is denied it. Nations fail when power is concentrated and abused. Nations succeed when power is distributed and checked. The fate of prosperity lies in the invisible architecture of rules.  

And so, as we run, we should keep this rhythm in mind: Institutions shape nations. Institutions decide futures. Inclusive rules create prosperity. Extractive rules create poverty.  

Let us take the first deep breath, the first strong stride, and step into the story of inclusive and extractive institutions. The story of why nations fail, and why others rise.

### Part II: Inclusive vs. Extractive Institutions

At the center of our journey lies a simple but powerful distinction: inclusive institutions versus extractive institutions. This is the heartbeat of nations, the pulse of prosperity or decline.  

Inclusive institutions are open. They create opportunities. They allow people to dream, to build, to compete, to win. They protect property. They enforce contracts. They give rights. They make it possible for new voices to rise. Inclusive institutions spread power broadly, so no single group can dominate forever.  

Extractive institutions are closed. They block opportunity. They trap people in systems of control. They take from many, and give to few. They deny property rights. They make contracts meaningless. They crush rights. They silence voices. They concentrate power, so elites can dominate for generations.  

Imagine two runners. One runs on a well-built track, smooth and open, with fair rules. She can see the finish line, she knows the rules are the same for everyone, she trusts that if she runs fast, she will be rewarded. This is an inclusive system. Now imagine another runner, trapped in a maze, with barriers and traps, with officials moving the finish line, with rivals tripping him at every turn. No matter how hard he runs, the system is against him. This is an extractive system.  

History is full of examples. In inclusive systems, like England after the Glorious Revolution, rules changed to limit royal power, expand Parliament, protect property, and encourage innovation. In extractive systems, like colonial Latin America, rules concentrated wealth and power in the hands of Spanish elites, trapping millions in poverty.  

The difference is not just abstract. It is life or death for nations. Inclusive systems create incentives. When you know your farm is safe, you plant more. When you know your idea is yours, you invent more. When you know your vote counts, you participate more. Extractive systems destroy incentives. When you know your farm can be seized, you plant less. When you know your idea will be stolen, you stop inventing. When you know your voice will be silenced, you give up.  

Growth, then, is not about resources. It is not about luck. It is about incentives shaped by institutions. Inclusive institutions push nations forward. Extractive institutions pull nations back.  

And this battle never ends. Inclusive systems are always at risk of becoming extractive. Extractive systems are always at risk of collapse. Nations rise, and nations fall, not because of destiny, but because of their choices. Choices about power, about rules, about institutions.  

As you run, feel the rhythm: Inclusive rules create growth. Extractive rules destroy it. This is the drumbeat of nations, the cadence of history, the pulse of prosperity.

### Part III: History as Evidence

History offers proof. Nations rise and fall, not because of fate, but because of their institutions. Let us look at the evidence, step by step, stride by stride.  

England in the seventeenth century was a turning point. Before the Glorious Revolution of 1688, kings ruled with near-absolute power. They could seize property, silence critics, and crush dissent. But when Parliament rose, when property was protected, when rules were rewritten, the economy surged. The Industrial Revolution followed, driven by inventors, entrepreneurs, and risk-takers who trusted the rules. Inclusive institutions gave birth to modern prosperity.  

Contrast this with Spain in the Americas. Conquistadors came not to build inclusive systems, but to extract wealth. Gold and silver were taken, indigenous people were enslaved, land was monopolized. The rules were extractive from the start. Innovation was blocked, incentives were destroyed. Centuries later, many Latin American nations still struggle under the legacy of extractive institutions.  

Another case: the Industrial Revolution itself. Why England, and not France, or China, or the Ottoman Empire? Because England’s rules rewarded innovation. Patents protected inventors. Banks financed entrepreneurs. Parliament constrained kings. In other nations, rulers feared change. Innovation was dangerous, competition was threatening, new voices were silenced. Extractive institutions killed potential. Inclusive institutions unleashed it.  

And so the evidence grows. South Korea versus North Korea. Botswana versus Zimbabwe. The United States versus colonial empires. Everywhere, the pattern repeats: Inclusive rules bring growth. Extractive rules bring failure.  

The story of nations is a story written in institutions. To see this clearly, we must travel through time and space, examining the evidence. Step by step, we uncover how rules made or broke societies.

#### The Glorious Revolution: England’s Turning Point  

Before 1688, England was unstable. Kings dissolved parliaments, raised taxes without consent, seized property at will. Merchants and farmers lived with uncertainty. Why risk planting more crops, if the king could take them? Why risk investing in ships, if a royal decree could seize them? Innovation was dangerous, progress fragile.  

Then came the Glorious Revolution. Parliament asserted control, limiting royal power. Property rights became secure. Courts gained independence. The rules of the game changed. Suddenly, people could trust the system. Farmers invested. Merchants expanded. Inventors dreamed. Banks lent money. Industry grew. The Industrial Revolution followed.  

It was not geography that changed—England’s soil was the same. It was not culture—English culture existed long before. It was the rules. Inclusive institutions opened the path to prosperity.  

#### Spanish America: The Legacy of Extraction  

Now contrast with Spanish colonies in the Americas. When conquistadors arrived, their goal was not to build inclusive systems. Their goal was to extract wealth. Gold and silver were mined, shipped back to Spain. Encomiendas gave elites control over indigenous labor. Land was concentrated in the hands of the few.  

The rules were extractive from the beginning. Wealth flowed upward. Power stayed closed. Innovation was discouraged. Why improve, if elites only wanted tribute? Why build, if profits would be taken?  

Centuries passed, and the pattern remained. After independence, the institutions stayed extractive. Elites kept control. Land remained concentrated. The system blocked broad participation. Even today, many Latin American nations wrestle with inequality rooted in these extractive origins.  

#### The Industrial Revolution: Why England, Not China?  

The Industrial Revolution transformed the world. But why did it begin in England, not in richer, larger empires like China or the Ottoman Empire?  

China had advanced technology. The compass, gunpowder, paper, printing—all were Chinese inventions. Yet China’s rulers feared change. Innovation threatened stability. Merchants were restricted. Exploration was banned. Property rights were weak. The Qing dynasty saw control as more important than growth. Institutions were extractive, not inclusive.  

The Ottoman Empire, too, resisted innovation. Printing presses were banned for centuries. Guilds blocked competition. Elites feared new ideas. Power stayed concentrated. Opportunity stayed closed.  

In England, the story was different. Inclusive institutions gave inventors rights. Patents protected ideas. Banks funded projects. Parliament limited rulers. Innovation was not feared—it was rewarded. The rules created incentives, and the incentives created growth.  

#### The American Experiment: Inclusive Beginnings  

Across the Atlantic, English colonies in North America followed a different path from Spanish colonies in South America. In the north, land was distributed more broadly. Farmers owned property. Local assemblies gave people a voice. The rules, though imperfect, leaned toward inclusivity.  

This difference mattered. When the United States declared independence, it built on traditions of property rights and representation. Inclusive institutions allowed commerce to flourish, innovation to grow, and democracy to expand. The path was not easy, but the foundations were stronger.  

#### The Soviet Union: Growth Without Freedom  

In the twentieth century, the Soviet Union seemed to defy the pattern. It grew rapidly, industrialized quickly, and built military power. But its institutions were extractive. Property was state-owned. Innovation was controlled. Dissent was punished.  

For a time, central planning delivered growth. But it was growth without freedom, growth without inclusion. Eventually, inefficiency, corruption, and stagnation set in. Without inclusive institutions, the system collapsed.  

#### South Korea vs. North Korea: A Natural Experiment  

The most striking evidence comes from the Korean peninsula. In 1950, Korea was divided. Same people, same culture, same geography. But two different sets of rules.  

South Korea built inclusive institutions. Property rights were protected. Markets were encouraged. Education was expanded. Over time, democracy grew. South Korea became one of the world’s richest nations.  

North Korea built extractive institutions. Power concentrated in the hands of one family. Property was confiscated. Dissent was crushed. Innovation was forbidden. North Korea became one of the poorest nations in the world.  

The difference is not culture. It is not geography. It is institutions. Two nations, one people, two destinies.  

---

The evidence is clear. From England’s revolution to Spanish America’s legacy, from China’s stagnation to Korea’s divergence, the same pattern repeats. Inclusive rules create prosperity. Extractive rules create failure.  

This is the rhythm of history. This is the cadence of nations. Step after step, the evidence builds. Nations rise when rules open doors. Nations fall when rules close them.  

---

### Part IV: Modern Echoes  

The story of nations is not only history. It is alive today, echoing in the modern world. As we run forward, let us explore how these lessons shape our present.  

#### China’s Paradox  

China has grown rapidly over the past forty years. Hundreds of millions lifted from poverty. Cities built at breathtaking speed. Exports flooding the world. But its institutions remain extractive. The Communist Party controls power. Dissent is silenced. Property rights are uncertain. Courts are not independent.  

So why the growth? Because China opened markets just enough to unleash productivity. Farmers gained incentives. Entrepreneurs found opportunities. Foreign investment flowed in. Growth surged.  

But the paradox remains. Can a nation sustain growth under extractive rules? History suggests no. Without inclusive institutions, innovation slows, corruption grows, elites tighten control. Growth may stall, collapse may follow. China runs fast, but is it running toward an open road, or back onto the treadmill?  

#### Latin America’s Cycles  

In Latin America, cycles repeat. Booms in commodities bring hope. Busts bring crisis. Elites rise, then fall, then rise again. Institutions remain fragile, often extractive. Inequality endures. The rules rarely open fully. Prosperity flickers, but does not last.  

#### The African Struggle  

Africa’s story is complex. Colonial rule left extractive institutions, designed to extract resources, not build inclusive systems. After independence, many nations inherited weak, corrupt, centralized states. Elites often replaced colonizers, but kept the same extractive structures.  

Yet there are exceptions. Botswana built inclusive institutions after independence. Property rights were protected, corruption limited, growth encouraged. It became one of Africa’s richest nations. Proof again that rules, not fate, shape destiny.  

---

The echoes are everywhere. Nations rise and fall, not by chance, but by choice. The choice of rules. Inclusive or extractive. Open or closed. Fair or corrupt.  

As you run, feel the beat: Institutions decide. Institutions decide. Institutions decide.  

---


The past is not dead. Its rhythm beats in our world today. The same institutional forces that shaped empires and revolutions still shape prosperity and poverty. As you run, keep in mind: the road of nations is long, but the rules are what pave the way.  

#### The Middle East: Oil Without Inclusion  

For many countries in the Middle East, oil wealth created sudden riches. But oil alone does not guarantee broad prosperity. Oil is a resource, and resources without inclusive rules often become a curse.  

In Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and other oil states, wealth flowed upward. Elites, royal families, and small circles controlled the revenues. Citizens gained some benefits, but not inclusive rights. Political power remained concentrated. Economic opportunity stayed limited outside the oil industry. The result: fragile prosperity, dependent on a single resource.  

Contrast with Norway. Oil was discovered there too. But Norway had inclusive institutions already in place: democracy, strong rule of law, independent courts. Oil wealth was invested in a sovereign fund, managed transparently, shared across generations. Norway turned oil into sustainable prosperity. The Middle East turned oil into dependence and volatility. Once again, the rules made the difference.  

#### The United States: Inclusive Roots, Growing Tensions  

The United States was long considered the model of inclusive institutions. Property rights, democracy, innovation, and broad participation fueled its rise. Immigrants brought energy, entrepreneurs built empires, inventors transformed the world. Inclusive rules created prosperity.  

But even inclusive nations face risks. In recent decades, inequality has grown. Political polarization has deepened. Money has concentrated in lobbying, corporations, and elites. Some fear that extractive forces are gaining ground. Will the U.S. maintain its inclusive character, or drift toward closed systems? History warns that no nation is immune.  

#### Africa: Diverging Paths  

Africa shows both tragedy and hope. Many nations still struggle under extractive institutions, rooted in colonial systems. Corruption drains wealth. Elites control power. Citizens face barriers to opportunity. Poverty persists despite natural resources.  

Yet there are examples of success. Botswana, as noted, built inclusive rules and grew steadily. Mauritius diversified its economy, invested in education, and created broad opportunities. Rwanda rebuilt after genocide with strong state-led growth, though questions remain about political openness. Africa’s story is not written in stone—it depends on the rules nations choose.  

#### Latin America: The Persistence of Inequality  

Latin America remains caught between promise and failure. Rich in resources, blessed with young populations, close to global markets—yet often trapped by extractive rules. Land inequality, weak rule of law, and corruption repeat across countries.  

Chile once seemed a beacon, with inclusive growth and democratic institutions. But mass protests in 2019 revealed deep inequalities. Brazil oscillates between democracy and corruption scandals, hope and disappointment. Venezuela collapsed under extractive socialism, turning oil wealth into poverty.  

The lesson is the same: without strong, inclusive rules, prosperity cannot endure.  

#### China’s Uncertain Future  

China’s paradox looms large in the modern world. It has grown at astonishing speed, lifting hundreds of millions from poverty, building cities, highways, and industries. Yet its institutions remain extractive. The Communist Party controls all power. Property rights are weak, courts obey politics, dissent is crushed.  

Can this model survive? Some argue China will innovate and grow despite control. Others warn that history is clear: extractive systems eventually stagnate. The question is not if, but when. The treadmill of extraction can carry a nation far, but not forever.

### The Patterns of Today  

As we look across the modern world, the patterns echo the past:  

- **Inclusive nations**—where rules are fair, rights are broad, opportunities are open—prosper.  
- **Extractive nations**—where rules are corrupt, power is concentrated, opportunity is blocked—struggle.  
- **Mixed nations**—where some rules are inclusive, but others extractive—face tension, uncertainty, and risk.  

Institutions are the deciding factor. Not culture, not geography, not luck. The rules of the game shape the score.  

---

### Part V: The Road Ahead  

Now we turn to the future. What lies ahead for nations, for societies, for us? Can extractive systems reform? Can inclusive systems endure? Can the lessons of history guide the path forward?  

#### Can Extractive States Reform?  

History shows that extractive states rarely reform willingly. Elites who hold power have little reason to share it. Why open doors, when closed doors enrich them? Why risk change, when the status quo secures their wealth?  

Yet sometimes, reform happens. Crises can break extractive systems. Revolutions can topple elites. Wars can destroy old rules. External shocks can force change. But reform is rare, fragile, and often violent. Most extractive systems cling to power until collapse.  

#### Why Foreign Aid Fails  

Many have hoped foreign aid could rescue poor nations. Billions have been spent. Schools built, wells dug, clinics funded. Yet aid often fails. Why? Because aid cannot change institutions. If the rules remain extractive, aid is captured by elites, wasted in corruption, or used to strengthen the regime.  

True change requires institutional reform, not charity. Without inclusive rules, aid is like water poured on sand—it vanishes.  

#### The Role of Political Centralization  

For prosperity, nations need more than inclusion. They also need strong central states. Without centralization, rules cannot be enforced, property cannot be protected, law cannot be applied. Anarchy and fragmentation kill growth as surely as tyranny.  

The best path combines both: centralized authority with inclusive participation. Strong states, with broad rights. Power enough to enforce rules, but not enough to abuse them. This balance is rare, precious, and fragile.  

#### The Challenges of the 21st Century  

New challenges rise before us. Technology, globalization, climate change, inequality—all test institutions.  

- **Technology** can empower, but also concentrate power. Who controls data, AI, and networks? Inclusive rules can spread benefits. Extractive rules can turn technology into tools of control.  
- **Globalization** connects markets, but can deepen inequality. Will nations open opportunities, or protect elites?  
- **Climate change** threatens stability. Will nations build inclusive systems to adapt, or will elites hoard resources?  
- **Inequality** grows worldwide. Can inclusive nations sustain fairness, or will extractive forces rise again?  

The road ahead is uncertain. But the lessons of history are clear: the future depends on the rules we build.  

---

### Closing: Running with Nations  

As you run, feel the rhythm of nations. The pounding of history, the stride of institutions, the breath of prosperity. Nations rise and fall like runners on a track. Some sprint, some stumble, some collapse. The difference is not fate, but rules.  

Inclusive institutions open the road. Extractive institutions trap the treadmill. Prosperity is not destiny—it is choice. A choice of rules, of power, of who participates and who is excluded.  

And so we close with this cadence:  
Inclusive rules create growth. Extractive rules destroy it.  
Inclusive rules create freedom. Extractive rules enslave it.  
Inclusive rules build futures. Extractive rules erase them.  

Step after step, stride after stride, this is the story of nations. And as you run, you are not only moving your body—you are running with history, running with ideas, running with the destiny of nations.  

---

The future is not yet written. But the forces that shaped history still guide our path. Nations succeed or fail not by luck, but by choice. And in the 21st century, those choices will determine whether humanity climbs higher—or falls into decline.

#### Technology: Empowerment or Control  

Technology is the great accelerator of our age. Artificial intelligence, biotechnology, digital platforms, renewable energy—each carries the power to transform societies. Yet technology does not determine outcomes. Institutions do.  

In inclusive nations, technology empowers. When property rights are strong, inventors benefit from their ideas. When courts are independent, innovators trust the system. When competition is open, entrepreneurs rise. In such systems, technology spreads opportunity. It becomes a tool for freedom, prosperity, and shared progress.  

But in extractive nations, technology becomes a weapon of control. Surveillance monitors citizens. Artificial intelligence predicts dissent. The internet becomes a cage, not a window. Innovation is stifled, monopolies grow, elites tighten their grip. Technology without inclusive rules only strengthens extraction.  

History gives us warning. Printing presses empowered Europe’s Reformation, because institutions allowed free ideas. But in the Ottoman Empire, presses were banned for centuries, blocked by extractive rules. Today, digital tools face the same fork in the road. Will they liberate, or will they enslave? The answer depends not on the machine, but on the rules.  

#### Globalization: Connection or Inequality  

Globalization links nations like never before. Trade flows across oceans. Capital moves in seconds. Information travels instantly. The world has become a vast marketplace.  

For inclusive nations, globalization can be a blessing. Open markets expand opportunities. Diverse ideas fuel innovation. Exports bring wealth, imports bring choice. When rules are fair, globalization enriches many.  

For extractive nations, globalization often worsens inequality. Elites capture the gains, while workers see little benefit. Resources are sold, profits stolen, wealth leaves. The poor are left behind, trapped in poverty.  

Even in inclusive nations, globalization creates tension. Factories close, jobs move abroad, communities decline. If institutions fail to adapt—if education, retraining, and support do not expand—resentment grows. Populism rises. Extractive voices gain power.  

Globalization, like technology, is not destiny. It can be road or treadmill, liberation or trap. Institutions decide.  

#### Climate Change: Cooperation or Collapse  

Climate change is the ultimate test of institutions. Rising seas, stronger storms, spreading deserts—these challenges do not respect borders. They demand collective action.  

Inclusive institutions foster cooperation. Democracies debate policies, invest in clean energy, adapt infrastructure. Citizens are engaged, scientists are heard, long-term planning is possible. Progress may be slow, but the system can adjust.  

Extractive institutions block solutions. Elites profit from fossil fuels, resist change, silence critics. Citizens are excluded from decisions. Short-term gains outweigh long-term survival. The result is disaster.  

History warns us. Civilizations have fallen from environmental collapse—Easter Island, the Mayans, the Norse in Greenland. Each case showed extractive systems failing to adapt. The same risk looms today. Without inclusive rules, climate change could unravel prosperity everywhere.  

#### Inequality: The Fragile Balance  

Inequality is not new, but it is growing. In many nations, the gap between rich and poor has widened. Wealth concentrates, opportunity narrows, resentment grows.  

Inclusive institutions can manage inequality. Progressive taxation, universal education, fair labor laws—these spread opportunity, keep the system balanced. They ensure growth is shared, not hoarded.  

Extractive institutions amplify inequality. Elites capture resources, bend laws, corrupt politics. The poor are excluded, the middle stagnates, mobility vanishes. In such systems, inequality is not just unfair—it is dangerous. It breeds instability, unrest, and collapse.  

History speaks clearly. Rome fell when elites hoarded land, hollowing out the middle class. The French Revolution exploded when inequality became intolerable. The Gilded Age in the U.S. sparked reform because inequality threatened democracy itself.  

The same balance is at stake today. Inequality can erode even inclusive nations, pulling them toward extraction. The treadmill waits, if rules fail.  

---

### The Choice of Our Century  

The road ahead is filled with forks. Technology, globalization, climate, inequality—each presents two paths. One leads to inclusion, growth, and resilience. The other leads to extraction, stagnation, and collapse.  

History does not dictate which path we take. It only teaches us the consequences of our choices. Nations are not bound by fate. They are shaped by rules. And rules are shaped by people.  

This is why the story of nations is also the story of individuals. Citizens who demand fairness. Leaders who choose reform. Inventors who dream despite obstacles. Activists who speak despite danger. Each step shapes the rules, and the rules shape the nation.  

The treadmill of history is always running. Nations can stay trapped, running in place under extraction. Or they can break free, running forward under inclusion.  

---

### Closing: Running with Nations  

As you run, remember the cadence of nations. Every stride echoes with history. Every breath mirrors the struggle for inclusion. Every heartbeat carries the rhythm of power and prosperity.  

The message of history is simple, yet profound:  
Inclusive institutions create prosperity.  
Extractive institutions create poverty.  

This truth repeats across centuries, across continents, across cultures. It is the law of nations, the drumbeat of history, the language of prosperity.  

So as you push forward, step after step, imagine running not just for yourself, but alongside nations. Imagine the United States, China, Africa, Europe, Latin America, all running on their own roads, their own treadmills. Some sprint, some stumble, some collapse. The difference is not luck—it is rules.  

Your run has rhythm. So does history. Nations fail when rules exclude. Nations thrive when rules include. This is the lesson of the past, the challenge of the present, the hope of the future.  

Run with it. Carry it. Never forget it.
