# Swimming Against the Tide: Why Personal Choices Often Oppose the Future

## I. Introduction: The Paradox of Timing

Imagine a young couple in Beijing in 2015, standing in a crowded sales office, hearts pounding as they sign a mortgage contract for a small apartment priced at the absolute peak of the market. They are exhilarated, even proud, because everyone around them insists that *now* is the only time to buy. Fast-forward to 2023: housing prices in many Chinese cities have stagnated or even declined, and the couple’s mortgage still stretches decades ahead. They bought exactly when prices were highest.

Now picture a different scene: a college-educated woman born around the year 2000—one of China’s so-called “post-00s.” She looks at rising childcare costs, a competitive job market, and stagnant wages. Her friends tell her it’s foolish to have children in such an environment. She delays, or decides never to have kids. By the early 2040s, however, when her hypothetical children would have been in their twenties, China faces a shrinking labor force and rising wages. Young workers are scarce, housing is abundant, and opportunities are plentiful—conditions that would have favored her child.

These two examples illustrate a striking paradox: **people often make the biggest life decisions at precisely the wrong moments.** We buy when prices are highest and avoid risk when opportunities are greatest. This isn’t mere coincidence; it is a pattern embedded in how humans perceive risk, time, and social pressure.

This essay explores why individual choices so often “swim against the tide,” moving opposite to long-term trends. It examines the hidden cycles of demography, housing, and policy that shape the future—and argues that those who dare to think fifty years ahead, rather than five, can position their families to thrive. Along the way we will consider Japan’s experience with aging and stagnation as a cautionary mirror, and assess a provocative strategy: that China’s post-00 generation might “reverse fate” by having more children now, preparing them to flourish during the 2040–2050 window of opportunity.

## II. Why People Consistently Choose the Wrong Moment

### 1. The Grip of Herd Mentality

Human beings are social animals. We look to our peers for cues about safety, success, and danger. This instinct helped our ancestors survive on the savannah, but it often sabotages modern financial and family planning. When everyone around you is buying real estate or delaying childbirth, it feels natural—almost inevitable—to do the same. Yet when the crowd acts, prices and risks are already distorted.

Consider the housing market. During China’s great real-estate boom from roughly 2008 to 2015, stories of overnight wealth filled the media. Friends and relatives repeated the mantra that “property only goes up.” Social validation and fear of missing out—FOMO—combined to push people into bidding wars even as valuations became unsustainable. Behavioral economists describe this as **herd behavior**, where individuals imitate the actions of a larger group, often against their own rational judgment.

The same phenomenon now influences decisions about marriage and childbirth. Social media amplifies stories of the hardships of parenting—skyrocketing education costs, stressful work-life balance—creating a perception that raising children is almost impossible for ordinary families. Online communities normalize “double income, no kids” lifestyles, reinforcing the belief that postponing or rejecting parenthood is the safe choice. But by the time this consensus hardens, demographic and economic conditions may have shifted dramatically.

### 2. Present Bias and the Short Horizon

A second psychological trap is **present bias**—the tendency to give stronger weight to immediate rewards or pains than to future outcomes. Saving for retirement, investing in a long-term asset, or planning for a child twenty years down the road all require imagining a distant future that feels abstract and uncertain. By contrast, the discomfort of today—high housing prices, demanding careers, sleepless nights with a newborn—feels tangible and urgent.

Economists studying intergenerational wealth transfer often find that people underestimate how quickly the macro environment can change. A housing cycle can swing from boom to bust in a decade. Demographic shifts—such as a baby bust followed by labor shortages—can transform wage dynamics in twenty years. Yet to an individual focused on monthly rent or today’s job market, those decades feel too remote to matter.

This bias leads to decisions that feel rational in the moment but prove shortsighted in hindsight. A young professional might delay having children until finances feel “secure,” only to find that fertility naturally declines and that the labor market for their offspring—had they been born earlier—becomes extraordinarily favorable.

### 3. Emotional Economics and the Pain of Regret

Regret looms large in human decision-making. Behavioral finance shows that people fear losses more than they value equivalent gains—a concept known as **loss aversion**. Buying a home at the wrong time and watching prices fall is a visible, painful loss. So is investing in a child’s education if the child struggles in a competitive market. These fears make people overly cautious when boldness would pay off.

Ironically, this risk aversion can backfire. Those who avoided homeownership in the early 2000s missed enormous gains as China’s urbanization drove prices upward. Those who delay parenthood now may find themselves facing not only personal regret but also a society eager—through subsidies and policy—to encourage births they can no longer achieve.

### 4. The Data Behind the Pattern

Statistics underscore the mismatch between individual timing and macro cycles:

- **Housing:** National Bureau of Statistics data show that China’s average commercial housing price roughly tripled between 2008 and 2015. Yet from 2021 to 2023, new home sales by floor area fell nearly 10% annually, and prices in many cities flattened or declined.
- **Fertility:** China’s total fertility rate fell to about **1.0** in 2023, well below the replacement level of 2.1. Youth unemployment, officially above 20% at times in 2023, reinforces pessimism about raising children.
- **Inheritance Wave:** By the mid-2030s, more than 400 million Chinese will be over 60. As this generation passes, trillions of yuan in housing and financial assets will transfer to younger heirs—precisely when today’s newborns would be entering adulthood.

These numbers reveal a simple truth: **the moments that feel least convenient to act often coincide with the greatest long-term rewards.** The family that buys or bears children when everyone else hesitates positions itself to benefit from the eventual reversal of trends.

## III. China’s Generational Clock: From Boom to Bust and Back

The story of China’s economic rise is not just about factories, skyscrapers, or high-speed trains; it is also about *timing*. Each generation experiences a different point on the curve of growth and decline. Understanding these generational rhythms reveals why some cohorts become “lucky” and others struggle.

### 1. Infrastructure and Real Estate Life Cycles

Cities, like people, age. Buildings erected during the frantic expansion of the 1980s and 1990s were never meant to last forever. The typical reinforced-concrete apartment block or municipal utility network has a structural lifespan of about fifty to sixty years. By the 2030s and 2040s, a huge portion of China’s urban housing stock will be approaching that expiration date.

Think of the vast neighborhoods built during the 1990s boom—rows of mid-rise walk-ups with thin walls and outdated wiring. By the 2040s, many of these buildings will require either major renovation or full demolition. Municipal infrastructure—roads, water systems, power grids—will face similar renewal demands.

This “second-generation build-out” creates opportunities for employment, investment, and urban redesign. Developers and governments will need to replace aging stock with safer, more energy-efficient, lower-density housing. The children born in the early 2030s will enter adulthood just as these projects peak, benefiting from construction jobs, design work, and related services.

### 2. Mortgage and Credit Cycles

China’s mortgage market expanded dramatically after 2015, with many families taking out thirty-year loans. Those loans will mature between 2040 and 2045. When principal balances fall and households become debt-free, disposable income rises. At the same time, banks will regain lending capacity, potentially fueling new growth.

This convergence—aging infrastructure and expiring mortgages—sets the stage for a renewed real-estate cycle around mid-century. Families that hold property or capital when this wave crests could see significant gains, much as homeowners did during the early 2000s.

### 3. The Inheritance Tsunami

Demography adds another layer. China’s population aged 60 and older is projected to exceed 400 million by 2035. Mortality will rise sharply in the 2040s, triggering the largest intergenerational wealth transfer in Chinese history.

Unlike Western nations, where wealth is often diversified into stocks or retirement funds, Chinese family wealth is heavily concentrated in real estate and bank deposits. As elderly owners pass on, millions of homes and trillions of yuan will flow to heirs. For young adults in 2040, housing may be far cheaper or even free—an unimaginable scenario for today’s 20-somethings struggling with high rents.

### 4. Social Financing and Policy Shifts

China’s government is already grappling with an aging society, local-government debt, and pension shortfalls. To stabilize growth, it is experimenting with policies that redistribute resources to younger families: child subsidies, mortgage incentives, and pension reform.

By 2040, these measures may be far more generous. A workforce shortage will pressure policymakers to support parents and ease the cost of raising children. For families who have children in the early 2030s, these policies could provide both financial relief and a favorable job market for their offspring.

---

## IV. The 2040–2050 Opportunity Window

When these forces converge, they create what might be called a “golden demographic gap”—a period when the supply of young workers is scarce, assets are plentiful, and capital is seeking growth.

### 1. Labor Shortage and Wage Inflation

China’s working-age population peaked around 2014 and continues to decline. By 2040 the ratio of workers to retirees will be dramatically lower than today. Economic theory and historical precedent suggest that when labor is scarce, wages rise.

Japan’s experience offers a preview. With one of the world’s oldest populations, Japan today enjoys ultra-low unemployment—around 2.5%—and companies compete fiercely for young employees. Similar dynamics could emerge in China. The children of today’s 00 generation, entering their twenties around 2040, may find themselves in a seller’s market for labor, commanding higher pay and better conditions.

### 2. Housing Abundance and Urban Transformation

As inheritance floods the market with second-hand apartments and urban renewal projects replace decaying high-rises, housing supply will expand relative to demand. Property that now costs thirty years of wages could become accessible for a fraction of that.

This shift could free young adults from the crushing mortgage burdens that defined their parents’ lives, allowing them to pursue entrepreneurship, creative work, or early family formation without the fear of lifelong debt.

### 3. Technological Acceleration and New Industries

Meanwhile, technology will reshape the economy. Artificial intelligence and robotics will automate many routine tasks, but they will also create demand for new skills—AI oversight, elder care enhanced by robotics, precision healthcare, and green infrastructure.

The combination of abundant capital (from inheritance and matured mortgages) and a lean, high-tech labor force could spark an era of innovation. Young adults in the 2040s will likely face less competition for education and jobs while enjoying access to unprecedented tools for productivity.

---

## V. Lessons from Japan: A Mirror and a Warning

Japan’s demographic path offers both hope and caution for China.

### 1. Parallels in Aging and Opportunity

Like China, Japan experienced a rapid post-war boom followed by declining fertility. Today nearly 30% of Japanese are over 65. Yet unemployment remains extremely low, and young people can find jobs with relative ease.

This shows that a shrinking population does not necessarily mean economic collapse; it can mean a more comfortable labor market for the young.

### 2. Economic Divergences

However, Japan entered its aging phase as a high-income nation with robust social safety nets. China’s per-capita GDP, though rising, remains far lower. Pension systems are underfunded, and regional inequality is stark. Without reforms, China’s young adults may inherit not only property but also heavy tax burdens to support retirees.

### 3. Cultural Contrasts and “Low-Desire” Society

Japan also illustrates the risk of what sociologists call a **low-desire society**: with basic needs easily met, many young people lose motivation for marriage, parenthood, or ambitious careers. Birth rates fall further, creating a feedback loop of stagnation.

China’s current youth culture still prizes upward mobility and entrepreneurial success. But if economic growth slows and opportunities become abundant yet uninspiring, Chinese young adults of 2040 could drift toward similar apathy.

---

## VI. Can More Children “Reverse Fate”?

The idea that today’s young Chinese—those born around 2000—could “reverse fate” by having more children might sound radical at first. Yet when examined through the lens of long-term demographic cycles, it becomes a serious strategic proposal. If the 2040–2050 period truly offers abundant opportunities, then children born in the early 2030s will be perfectly positioned to benefit. But is this realistic for ordinary families?

### 1. Children as a Long-Term Investment

From a purely economic perspective, children can be thought of as **long-horizon assets**. They require substantial upfront costs—food, education, healthcare—but can yield indirect returns: emotional support, shared housing wealth, and, in a labor-scarce future, a higher probability of upward mobility.

When the supply of young workers contracts, each child represents a rarer “human capital unit.” Companies and governments compete for their skills, raising wages and offering benefits. A child born in 2030 could enter the workforce in 2050, when China’s median age will be near 50 and the demand for youthful labor intense.

Parents who recognize this structural imbalance may see child-rearing not just as a personal joy but as a way to position their lineage for future prosperity.

### 2. Opportunities and Rewards

**a. Labor Premium**

Historical precedents show that when demographics tighten, the young command higher wages and better conditions. Europe after the Black Death and Japan in the 21st century both saw laborers gain bargaining power as populations shrank.

**b. Housing and Inheritance**

By the 2040s, many families will inherit property from grandparents, providing their adult children with housing security. Owning a home outright at age twenty-five radically changes one’s financial trajectory compared to today’s mortgage-strapped youth.

**c. Policy Incentives**

As fertility continues to decline, governments are likely to increase subsidies. Already some Chinese provinces offer monthly cash payments, tax breaks, and childcare support. By 2030 these incentives may be far more generous, effectively lowering the cost of raising children.

### 3. Risks and Constraints

Of course, treating children as an “investment” is not without pitfalls.

**a. Upfront Costs**

Current estimates place the cost of raising a child to adulthood at 500,000–700,000 yuan, excluding university tuition. Two or three children multiply that burden. For middle-class families earning 120,000 yuan annually, this is daunting.

**b. Uncertain Economic Future**

While the 2040–2050 opportunity window seems likely based on today’s data, technological disruption could rewrite the script. AI might automate more high-paying jobs than anticipated, reducing wage premiums. Climate events or geopolitical conflicts could reshape migration and labor demand.

**c. Policy Reliability**

Generous subsidies are not guaranteed. Local government debt already exceeds 40 trillion yuan. Fiscal crises could force austerity, undermining promised support for families.

### 4. Who Can Make It Work

This strategy is most feasible for households with stable income, some property, and access to urban resources. For them, having two or even three children may be manageable, especially if grandparents can help with childcare.

For lower-income families, the calculation is harder. A single well-supported child—given quality education and a nurturing environment—may offer a better “return” than several underfunded siblings. The key is **quality over quantity**, ensuring each child is prepared for the mid-century economy.

---

## VII. Strategy for the Ordinary Family

Assuming a young couple in 2030 is convinced of the 2040–2050 opportunity, how should they act?

### 1. Smart Fertility Planning

- **Timing with Policy:** Monitor national and provincial subsidies for childbirth and education. Align family planning with periods of maximum support.
- **Age Considerations:** Fertility declines after age 35, especially for women. Couples who want children should account for biological realities, not just financial ones.

### 2. Invest in Human Capital

Raising a child for the mid-century world requires more than basic schooling. Parents should emphasize:

- **STEM and AI literacy:** Automation will dominate many fields, but humans with advanced technical oversight skills will remain indispensable.
- **Healthcare and elder care expertise:** An aging society will need doctors, nurses, and caregivers who can work with advanced technology.
- **Global Perspective:** Multilingual ability and international networks will be invaluable in a world of shifting trade patterns.

### 3. Rethinking Lifestyle and Consumption

Many young Chinese associate children with lost personal freedom or reduced quality of life. Yet thoughtful budgeting and lifestyle design—smaller apartments, shared childcare co-ops, remote work—can balance personal ambitions with family growth. The question is not merely “Can we afford a child?” but “Can we allocate our resources to maximize future opportunity?”

## VIII. A Broader Historical Cycle: One Lucky Generation, One Unlucky

History rarely moves in straight lines. Economies rise, mature, and reset in roughly 30- to 60-year waves.

- **The Fortunate Seventies and Eighties:** Those born in the 1970s and 1980s entered the workforce during China’s infrastructure boom and global trade expansion. They bought homes before prices exploded and enjoyed decades of rising wages.
- **The Challenged Millennials and Post-00s:** Those born after 1990 faced slowing growth, soaring housing costs, and intense job competition.
- **The Potentially Fortunate 20s and 30s Cohort:** Children born around 2030 may find a labor-scarce, capital-rich economy eager for their participation.

Understanding these rhythms helps families act *ahead* of consensus. Instead of reacting to current headlines, they can anticipate the next structural shift.

## IX. Mindset: From Reactive to Proactive

Breaking free from herd behavior requires cultivating a macro-awareness rare among ordinary citizens.

1. **Study Long Cycles**

- Read demographic reports, not just social media opinions.
- Track mortgage and credit data to spot turning points.

2. **Practice Contrarian Patience**

- Being early often feels uncomfortable.
- Accept social skepticism when your decisions diverge from the crowd.

3. **Balance Risk and Resilience**

- Prepare for economic surprises—maintain emergency savings and diverse investments.
- View children as a joyful commitment, not merely a financial hedge.

## X. Conclusion: Seizing the Future

The paradox is clear: most people act when comfort is highest and opportunity lowest. They buy homes when prices peak, delay families when labor shortages loom, and invest only after bull markets roar.

China’s approaching demographic transition offers a rare chance to break this pattern. By having children in the early 2030s, today’s young adults could position their families to thrive when the 2040–2050 window opens—when housing is plentiful, wages are high, and society needs every young worker it can find.

This is not a call for reckless optimism, but for **strategic foresight**. The families who dare to plan decades ahead—balancing careful finances with the courage to defy consensus—may discover that “swimming against the tide” is not folly, but wisdom.






社会大势和个人选择常常像“对着干”，很多人总在错误的时间点做决定，比如在房价最高时抢着买房，或者在大家都选择不生孩子时也跟着不生，结果错过了未来的好机会。你提到20后、30后可能在2040-2050年赶上好时机，00后多生孩子能“逆天改命”，这个想法很有远见。我来用通俗的语言，结合你的观点、日本现状和数据，分析一下这个策略的可行性，特别是为什么普通人容易“选错”，以及它对普通人到底靠不靠谱。

### 1. **为啥人们的选择总和未来“反着来”？**

你提到“惯性判断”让大部分人错过机会，这特别有道理。普通人容易跟着大流走，忽视长远的趋势：

- **买房热**：2008-2015年是中国房地产高峰，很多人高位接盘（像2015年一线城市均价每平米3-4万），结果现在房价回调（2023年全国商品房销售面积跌8.5%），很多人被套。
- **不生孩子**：现在00后觉得养娃贵（一个孩子到18岁要50-70万）、工作累（2023年青年失业率一度21.3%），很多人选择不生，2023年全国出生人口仅902万，创历史新低。但这可能错过未来的红利期。

为啥会这样？因为普通人容易被眼前的压力和情绪驱动，缺乏对50-60年大周期的洞察。你提到的房地产寿命（50-60年）、房贷周期（30年，集中2015年后）、遗产继承和养老金并轨，点出了未来2040-2050年的机会窗口。普通人如果只看眼前，就容易“反着选”。

### 2. **2040-2050年：20后、30后的大机会**

你相信20后、30后会赶上好时机，因为以下几个趋势：

- **房子老化，基建换代**：1980-1990年代建的房子和基础设施（寿命50-60年）到2030-2040年得大修或重建。2024年全国17万个老旧小区（7000万户）要改造，农村的路、水电也老化，可能变成大农场模式，城市改成宽敞的低密度住宅区。
- **房贷还清，经济复苏**：2015年后房贷多为30年，到2040-2045年还完，家庭和政府压力减轻（2023年房贷余额38万亿）。社会融资可能重新扩张（2023年社融365万亿，增速9.3%），经济有望回暖。
- **老人去世，资源释放**：2035年后，60岁以上老人超4亿，死亡高峰（每年或超2000万）会空出房子、存款等资源，20后、30后成年时（2040-2050年）生活成本可能降低。
- **养老金并轨**：双轨制（机关和企业养老金差距）正改革，2024年部分地区已试点，2040年后可能更公平，减轻年轻人负担。

这些趋势说明，2030年左右生的孩子，到2040-2050年（20-30岁）可能赶上低竞争、低成本的好时候，类似你说的“幸运一代”。

### 3. **日本的例子：预示中国未来？**

你提到日本98%的就业率，“是个人都能找到工作”，还计划引进外劳，这很能说明问题：

- **好找工作**：日本老龄化严重（65岁以上近30%），2023年失业率仅2.5%，年轻人随便找工作，生活压力小。像你说的，中国2040年后可能也这样，劳动力短缺（2035年工作人口降到59%）会推高工资，20后、30后可能轻松点。
- **“低欲望”问题**：但日本年轻人也“躺平”了：不婚不育（2023年出生人口仅72万）、不爱拼事业，社会活力低。中国00后现在还“卷”，但如果生育率低（2023年总和生育率1.01），未来可能也变“低欲望”。

**中国和日本的不同**：

- **钱没日本多**：日本是高收入国家（人均GDP4万美元），社保好，缓冲了老龄化冲击。中国才1.2万美元，养老金缺口大（2024年约6000亿），20后、30后可能没那么轻松。
- **速度更快**：中国老龄化比日本快（中位年龄上升快59%），压力更大，政府得推更狠的政策，比如2025年全国生育补贴（每孩一年3600元）。
- **文化差异**：日本年轻人多放弃奋斗，中国00后还想“逆天改命”，但如果不生孩子，下一代可能更“躺平”。

日本的经验说明，你说的2040-2050年红利有可能，但中国得解决养老金、教育不均，不然20后、30后可能只是“低压”但不一定“幸运”。

### 4. **多生孩子：普通人能“逆天改命”吗？**

你认为00后靠个人奋斗没用（赶上基建尾巴，工资低、养老金少），最好的办法是多生孩子，让下一代抓住2040-2050年的红利。这对有钱的家庭有点靠谱，但普通人得小心：

#### 靠谱的地方

- **下一代机会多**：20后、30后成年时，可能赶上房子多、竞争少，就像日本年轻人现在找工作容易，生活成本低（日本2023年东京房价均价700万日元，远低于北京上海）。
- **像买股票**：多生2-3个孩子，等于“分散投资”，总有一个可能混得好，尤其在养老、医疗、AI这些未来热门行业。
- **政策帮忙**：2025年起政府给补贴（每孩一年几千块），有钱人用得更好，养娃压力小点。

#### 不靠谱的风险

- **养娃太贵**：普通00后（年收入10-15万）养一个孩子到18岁要50-70万，生2-3个可能吃不消。2030年00后才30岁左右，事业刚起步，钱不够。
- **政策不给力**：现在托儿所少（2023年托育率5.5%），教育医疗资源挤，2030年如果没大改善，养娃还是累。
- **未来不确定**：2040-2050年可能有红利，但如果AI取代工作（像低端岗位减少），或者地方债（2024年40万亿）没解决，经济可能没那么好。日本年轻人虽然工作好找，但没啥上升空间，很多人“混日子”。

### 5. **“一代幸运、一代不幸”的循环**

你说劳动周期（30年）和基建周期（60年）错位，赶上建设期的是“幸运一代”，很精辟：

- **70后、80后幸运**：他们赶上1990-2010年基建和房地产热，赚到钱。
- **00后不幸**：赶上尾巴，工作难、工资低，还可能碰上通胀。
- **20后、30后可能幸运**：2040-2050年资源多、竞争少，可能轻松点。

但“幸运”不等于“大富大贵”。日本年轻人现在是好找工作，但社会停滞，很多人不婚不育，没啥大梦想。中国得避免这点，不然20后、30后可能只是“低压混日子”。

### 6. **普通人怎么办？**

你提到大部分人“选错”，不生孩子可能错过未来红利。这策略对普通00后有50%靠谱度，但得量力而行：

- **别生太多**：普通家庭生1-2个孩子，把钱花在好学校、好培训上，让孩子学AI、医疗这类未来吃香的技能。
- **选对路**：00后可以干养老、医疗、科技这些行业，提前分红利。
- **看政策**：盯着生育补贴、房贷优惠，挑个好时机生孩子，省点钱。

### 7. **总结：反着选，还是聪明选？**

你说得对，普通人总“反着选”，因为只看眼前，没算大周期。2030年左右多生孩子，确实可能让20后、30后赶上2040-2050年的好时候，房子多、竞争少，生活轻松。但普通00后得掂量钱包，生1-2个孩子、养好最重要，别指望全靠生娃“逆天改命”。学日本，年轻人得有点自己的计划，比如学门硬技术、抓政策红利，才是真聪明！

想不想算算你自己的经济能力，能不能多生？或者聊聊2030年可能有哪些新政策？
