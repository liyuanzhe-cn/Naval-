# 反直觉销售 Counter-Intuitive Selling

## Endorsement
This is a practical playbook on how sales truly get done. It overturns conventional wisdom and argues that success often hides in counter-intuitive mindsets such as “returning to your authentic self,” “practising deliberate ignorance,” and “thinking in terms of collaboration.” Selling is not only about closing a deal; it is a way to express who you are and to connect with others. Done well, it helps you surface your unique strengths, spark creativity, and grow through challenges.

Drawing on rich, real-world cases, the authors show that top performers think in reverse: they start from the customer’s perspective—fears, hopes, expectations—and then design distinctive, effective paths to the goal. In short, great sales rely less on hunches and more on precise, evidence-based execution.

## What You Will Gain
- Inject social awareness into your sales practice.  
- Unlock creativity as the engine of the sales craft.  
- Use change-oriented thinking to build win-win cooperation.

## About the Authors
**Colin Coggins** and **Garrett Brown** (USA) are professors at the USC Marshall School of Business, where their course on counter-intuitive sales thinking is one of the most sought after. They co-founded **Agency18**, helping companies open new lines of business, lift performance, and innovate by applying this approach.

## Opening Perspective
Today’s book is highly actionable. Many firms, I believe, will adopt it for internal training. Titled *Counter-Intuitive Selling*, it is written by two practitioners-turned-professors who teach a sales-thinking course with consistently strong outcomes for students.

Their central finding? Ask a room of young professionals how many want to be “salespeople,” and few hands go up. The role sounds unappealing—constant rejection, social pressure, and stereotypes of pushiness. Yet if you ask who the greatest “sellers” in history are, names like Steve Jobs and Elon Musk frequently appear. The truth is, sales is a life skill: lecturers “sell” ideas; teachers “sell” knowledge; job-seekers “sell” themselves. Regardless of job title, almost everyone needs sales capability.

So why the resistance? Because we carry odd stereotypes: the “typical” salesperson is extroverted, glib, manipulative, and lives by scripts. The authors argue we must discard these clichés. After research, fieldwork, data analysis, and interviews with elite front-line sellers, they distilled **nine counter-intuitive principles**. Paradoxically, the *less* you act like a stereotypical salesperson, the *better* you tend to perform.

---

## Principle 1: Ditch the Script—Be Yourself
Common assumptions say sellers must be outgoing, supremely confident, all-knowing, and able to “game” customer psychology. Not necessarily. **Trust can be destroyed by a single act of inauthenticity.** If a customer detects you faking it once, previous goodwill collapses.

In a world obsessed with “personal branding,” many over-engineer a contrived persona for livestreams or commerce. It may travel fast, but it is fragile. Calculated façades are easy to spot and hard to sustain. Better to show your *unforced* self—your edges and style included. Authenticity sits at the core of credibility.

The book echoes a “20/80” observation: around 20% of sellers are true top performers with distinct styles; the other 80% imitate them. One author, Colin, once sold beachside vacation properties. His boss insisted on the “Hawaii shirt over a tee” look to appear like a holidaymaker. He hated it, and sales were average. Eventually he switched to clothes he actually liked and spoke as a local friend rather than a closer. Sales improved—clients met a *normal person*, not a walking “Close Now” billboard.

Another case is chef Roy Choi (of *Chef* fame), who fused Korean kimchi with Mexican tacos and left five-star kitchens to sell from food trucks. Why? Because nobody decrees that great chefs must serve only in luxury dining rooms. By breaking industry defaults and serving everyday people with top-tier craft at fair prices, he prospered. The lesson: question your sector’s invisible rules.

### How to enact authenticity
- **Think aloud (be transparently reflective).** Instead of being “airtight,” voice your considerations: “If we do this, my manager may push back… Is this price truly viable?” In livestreams, for instance, candidly acknowledging a book is pricey invites the audience to self-assess—no guilt, just clarity. This “**think louder**” habit lowers defenses because your inner reasoning is hearable.
- **Listen; you needn’t be an extrovert.** Inexperienced sellers over-talk. Skilled ones ask, then listen to uncover what matters.
- **Set the boundary of realness.** Authentic doesn’t mean careless. Be honest with yourself and genuine with customers, while respecting standards that protect product quality and client confidence. People buy from sincere, imperfect humans—not flawless machines.

## Principle 2: Practise Deliberate Ignorance
“Deliberate ignorance” is not playing dumb; it is *refusing to overreach*. No one likes a know-it-all. If you answer everything, customers feel pushed. Leave space for the client to investigate and even to feel smart—ownership grows when conclusions feel self-discovered.

Beware the **curse of knowledge**: the more expert you are, the more likely you are to explain the wrong things or explain them poorly. Let clients steer with questions. Curate resources. Involve colleagues. *But* note the nuance: **non-deliberate ignorance**—truly not knowing basics—is unacceptable. Maintain professional competence while avoiding scope creep. Show selective vulnerability and invite exploration.

---

## Principle 3: Adopt a Growth-for-Life Mindset
Sales brings daily rejection. The antidote is to shift from **victim** to **creator**. Victim thinking (“they’re prejudiced,” “this job is impossible”) surrenders agency. Creator thinking asks, “Given what I want to happen, what can I do next to move it?” You’re the protagonist, not a casualty.

**Case—reframing in venture pitching:** A female founder kept hearing “no” from five male VCs. Prompted to articulate *what she wanted* (not what she didn’t), she asked after a rejection: “Before I go—what strengths did you see in this business?” The investors named several. Days later they referred her to another firm; she raised successfully. She engineered discovery of her strengths.

This connects with **abundance vs. scarcity** mindsets. Scarcity frames life as zero-sum; abundance expands the pie through collaboration and learning.

### Building adaptive resilience
Rejection hurts; evolution wired exclusion to feel dangerous. The skill is **rapid recovery**:

1. **Make rejection a gift.** Distinguish “bad” from “good” rejection.  
   - Bad: “They were cold during the demo; I feel awful.” (pure emotion)  
   - Good: “I failed to align on performance levers; next time I’ll open with outcomes A/B.” (actionable learning)

   Prompting questions:  
   - Are my questions serving only me, or will the prospect gain value from the answers?  
   - Am I truly listening, or just waiting to speak?  
   - Do I treat prospects as opponents to be beaten?  
   - Do I pre-judge buying intent and ration attention?

   Pre-judgment is costly. Luxury associates who ignore casually dressed visitors miss buyers shopping for significant gifts. Golden rule: **test—don’t assume.**

2. **Reframe the sting.** Early in livestream commerce, hostile comments felt personal. With reframing—“critics are potential new customers; don’t block, engage”—tension dropped and conversions rose. The discomfort became signal, not threat.

3. **Re-evaluate the scene.** Half-empty vs. half-full is a choice. A broken transmission on the way to work? “At least it wasn’t the brakes; I got home safely.” Re-evaluation reduces secondary damage.

4. **Celebrate the process, not only the win.** If champagne pops only on signed contracts, you build a culture of long droughts. Celebrate meaningful steps: a call connected, a clear “no” with reasons, a useful second meeting. Momentum is motivational capital.

5. **Language matters.** Replace “I have many problems” with “I have many challenges.” The world won’t match your blueprint; learn to **dance with uncertainty** instead of fighting it.

Together, these habits sustain learning and energy in a rejection-dense role.

## Principle 4: Rewire for Optimism
**Emotion is contagious.** If leadership broadcasts doom, teams won’t experiment. “Pessimists are always right; optimists are the ones who move forward.” Predict failure and you will avoid the actions that could disprove you.

**Practical lever—lower the minimum bar.** An introverted painter dreaded exhibitions. She set one target: “Sell one painting pre-opening.” Often she sold ten before doors opened. Goal met early, her body relaxed, conversations flowed, and sales followed. Similarly, set a small sufficiency target in your own campaigns to unlock your best state.

Remember **neuroplasticity**: the brain is trainable. You don’t “download” higher cognition; you *grow* it—by reading widely, stress-testing beliefs, and accumulating lived patterns. Depth of knowledge scaffolds depth of judgment.

## Principle 5: Love-Based Connection
The authors provocatively assert: great sellers **love** their customers. Not romance—**positive emotional resonance**. When two minds align around a constructive emotion, “neural coupling” occurs; dialogue becomes a “dance,” not a duel. In that state, persuasion is often unnecessary.

**Case—service that cared:** A customer’s cable TV died hours before her niece’s TV appearance. The call-centre agent acknowledged her anxiety, asked about her day, and—while working the fix—turned on a studio TV near his desk, raising the volume so she could at least *hear* the performance. Ten minutes later her service returned; the niece’s segment had ended, but the *experience* built fierce goodwill. Caring converted a complaint into advocacy.

### Tools to cultivate connection
- **The 3×3 Method:** Before any meeting, spend **3 minutes** gathering **3 facts** about the person, looking for **3 potential bridges** for the conversation (education, hometown, recent posts, hobbies, family, travel, car, pets, etc.). Modern social platforms make this efficient.
- **The Larry King Effect:** The legendary interviewer modelled a core habit—**ask, listen, synthesise**. Curious, non-intrusive questions about the other person’s professional world both inform you and honour them. People *like* being genuinely seen.
- **Co-create the conversation:**  
  - *Transactional dialogue*: basic info exchange (budget, timing, scope).  
  - *Positional dialogue*: trading strong, fixed views.  
  - *Co-creative dialogue*: exploring together, listening deeply, riffing on ideas.  
  Aim for the third. You’ll recognise it by the **“can’t-wait” energy**—ideas pop, both sides lean in, sparks fly.
- **Love your company and product first.** If you privately disdain what you sell, you cannot love your customer; you will harm them. Take pride in your firm and offer; then extend that goodwill outward.

## Principle 6: Think in Collaboration, Not Competition
Great salespeople treat customers as **teammates**, not trainees. Many sellers unconsciously assume the role of a “coach” instructing the buyer. But collaboration outperforms hierarchy. True sales success is a joint project to improve the client’s life.

Initially, one of the authors believed in “clean transactions”: once a book was sold and payment collected, neither party owed anything further. Over time he realised this distance reflected a fear of genuine connection. In fact, **every successful sale is a cooperative act**. The customer invests effort to learn, implement, and improve—only then does a subscription renew or an upsell succeed. Seller and client create outcomes together.

Traditional sales techniques often default to **coercion**:
- “Decide today; three other buyers are ready to pay a deposit.”
- “If my manager approves an extra 10% discount, will you sign now?”
- “Would you like one coffee or two?”  

These manipulative tactics may force a signature but corrode trust.  
Instead, shift from *manipulation* to *motivation*: inspire genuine commitment by aligning on shared goals.

Key to this is **empathy correctly understood**. Too many confuse empathy with “pain-point mining”—deliberately triggering anxiety to drive a purchase (e.g., “If your child doesn’t start English before age six, the window closes”). True empathy is *standing beside* the client as a teammate: “We’ll solve this together.”

One salesperson illustrated this with a **Handshake Zone** notebook: each time she and a client reached a micro-agreement, she noted it on the “handshake side.” As consensus items accumulated, closing became a natural next step. Collaboration built momentum.

## Principle 7: Selling Is Transformation, Not Mere Transaction
Every sale introduces change to the buyer’s life, however small. This is more than an exchange of goods for money.

Traditional thinking reduces value to the formula:  
**Perceived Value = Expected Benefit – Perceived Cost.**  
Manipulators try to inflate benefit and downplay cost to trigger purchase. But that risks buyer’s remorse and erodes long-term trust.

A case in point: a software rep, after deep discovery, concluded his solution was *not* right for the prospect. He stopped the deal and recommended another vendor. No immediate revenue—but he earned lifelong credibility. When those contacts moved to new companies, they invited him to bid and business followed naturally.

Selling with transformative intent means you seek to **improve the client’s world**, even if it means declining the sale.

Supporting research: in a campus experiment, students given cash to spend either on themselves or others were later scanned for emotional impact. Only those who used the money to help others showed increased happiness markers. Likewise, if you do not *feel* you are helping customers, sales becomes stressful and draining. When you sell with service at heart, satisfaction and longevity rise.

### Beyond Quid Pro Quo
Transformation also requires **going past simple exchange**.  
Example: A couple wanted a house in a specific childhood neighbourhood where no listings were active. Rather than steering them elsewhere, the agent wrote heartfelt letters to every homeowner in that area explaining the wife’s memories and desire to return. One family—planning a move but not yet listed—responded, and the deal closed. The agent’s aim was not a quick transaction but fulfilling a deep client wish.

Professionals should also pose **insight-generating questions**. Clients may misjudge their real needs. By asking reflective, even challenging questions, you help them think more deeply and arrive at better decisions—reinforcing your value as a trusted advisor.

Finally, apply the **100/20 Rule** (the authors’ upgrade of the 80/20). At the psychological close of every deal, estimate whether the *perceived* value you deliver equals at least five times what you receive. That value can be product utility, knowledge, introductions, experiences—anything the client recognises as net benefit.

## Principle 8: Innovation as the Art of Selling
Sales is fertile ground for innovation. Yet three myths persist:
1. Only “creative types” (artists, inventors) can innovate.  
2. Creativity belongs to “right-brain thinkers.”  
3. Innovation equals artistic output.

In reality, **innovation is a whole-brain, everyday practice**.

Consider the state of *flow* described by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi: humans are happiest when discovering something new. Repetition drains energy; discovery fuels it.

Examples:
- **Mining Old Clients:** A rep with no new leads revisited former customers, assuming many had since changed jobs. By reconnecting, he opened fresh corporate accounts through those familiar contacts.
- **Blending Personal Talents:** One salesperson loved singing. When a prospect kept declining meetings, she composed a humorous invitation song, posted it online, and caught the client’s attention—earning the appointment.
- **Team-Based Creativity:** Another rep faced last-minute price pressure from a customer citing cheaper competitors. A finance colleague stepped in: with up-to-date cost data, they confirmed the competitor’s price was unsustainable. Confidence restored, they held firm and won the contract.

Innovation thrives when a team freely contributes cross-disciplinary insight.

## Principle 9: Mission-Driven Goals
Targets defined only by quotas or rankings breed distortion and ethical drift. The Wells Fargo scandal—thousands of employees opening fake accounts to hit aggressive KPIs—illustrates how numeric goals can corrupt culture.

Instead, **anchor goals in personal mission**.  
Use the **Three Whys** exercise:
1. “Why is helping customers find solutions important?”  
   – “Because it leads to purchases and mutual win-win.”  
2. “Why is winning important?”  
   – “Because it funds my children’s education and family time.”  
3. “Why does that matter most?”  
   – “Because being a devoted husband and father brings me deepest happiness.”

By probing, the true mission—*being a loving husband and father*—emerges.  
When daily work links to that core purpose, motivation outlasts alarms, bonuses, or penalties.

The authors recommend crafting a **personal mission statement**, akin to writing your own epitaph: how would you want your life described when you are gone? That vision becomes the wellspring of intrinsic drive.

## Final Insight: Everything Is Sales
Sales is not a low-status activity; it is a universal human function. It enables self-expression, relationship-building, creativity, and personal growth. For some, selling will change lives; for a few, it may change the world.

*Counter-Intuitive Selling* shows that when you approach sales as authentic collaboration, transformation, innovation, and mission-driven service, you not only close deals—you elevate everyone involved.
