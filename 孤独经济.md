# 孤独经济 The Loneliness Economy

## Recommendation
People are becoming increasingly lonely. The waves of urbanization push human beings onto concrete islands; smartphones decompose face-to-face contact into data traffic; social networks substitute “likes” for genuine emotional exchange. We are sinking into a whirlpool of **collective loneliness**.

From the perspectives of urbanization, wealth gaps, the business models of tech giants, the smartphone’s reshaping of human communication, and prolonged economic stagnation, the author asks why the West is facing a loneliness crisis, what its economic impacts are, and—if the trend continues—what the future might look like. By analyzing cases, she searches for ways to break the stalemate and to **reconstruct the distance model among people** in the digital age.

### What You Will Gain
- Understand why we are lonely and why people grow apart.  
- See the “invisible injuries” loneliness inflicts on physical and mental health.  
- Explore how intelligent technologies deepen our sense of isolation.

## Introduction: A Misleading Title and a Deeper Reality
The book discussed today is titled **The Loneliness Economy**. On first encounter, the Chinese title appears to promise a new business opportunity—ways to profit from the phenomenon of loneliness. In English, however, the book is **The Lonely Century**, which suggests a broader diagnosis. Perhaps the publisher hoped the economic angle would draw wider attention. Yet what I learned is more important than business prospects: **we are living in a lonely century**, and each of us will likely feel more solitude, to varying degrees, in the years ahead. To adapt to the future, we must face loneliness as a social problem.

Hertz is, at her core, a thinker—she offers thought, not mere tactics. We must first grasp why this is a century of loneliness. Since COVID-19, isolation intensified; we learned to keep our distance, even when picking up meals. After three years, many of us are more alone.

On a business trip to Manhattan, the author discovered a service called **“Rent-a-Friend.”** She booked it and spent a day strolling, chatting, and drinking coffee with a hired companion—a young woman. It felt delightful. When Hertz asked who the typical customers were, the companion replied: **“Lonely, 30–40-something professionals.”** The service is expensive, so the users are often high-income yet **emotionally unaccompanied** individuals who pay for affective support.

Surveys echo this landscape: **two-thirds of Germans, one-third of Dutch, one-quarter of Swedes, and two-fifths of Swiss** report feeling lonely. Loneliness is experiential—like the Japanese film *Shoplifters*, in which unrelated people cluster around an elderly woman out of need and emptiness: not a family by blood, but a fragile warmth against a cold world.

## Loneliness Hurts—Often as Much as a Pack-a-Day Habit
Popular culture romanticizes solitude—“enjoy being alone,” “single by choice.” Such phrases often reflect youth. The physical costs of loneliness can be severe—**roughly comparable to smoking 15 cigarettes a day**. Unlike smoking, however, loneliness carries **shame**; people will smoke openly, but they rarely admit to being lonely.

Gerontology offers a practical diagnostic: **look at an elder’s feet**. As *Being Mortal* points out, well-dressed seniors may still have neglected feet because it is difficult to wash them alone. The feet silently testify to solitary living.

### A Simple Loneliness Scale
Consider the following 20 items. For each, rate yourself 1–4: 4 = closer to loneliness, 1 = farther from it. If your **total ≥ 43**, you are likely lonely.

1) Do you often feel your relationships are harmonious?  
2) Do you often feel a lack of companionship?  
3) Do you often feel you have no one to trust?  
4) Do you often feel lonely?  
5) Do you often feel integrated into a group of friends?  
6) Do you often feel you share much in common with others?  
7) Do you often feel close to no one?  
8) Do you often feel your interests and ideas differ from those around you?  
9) Do you often feel you want to socialize and make friends?  
10) Do you often feel a desire for closeness?  
11) Do you often feel neglected?  
12) Do you often feel your social contacts are meaningless?  
13) Do you often feel no one truly understands you?  
14) Do you often feel isolated by others?  
15) Do you often feel you can find partners when needed?  
16) Do you often feel truly understood by someone?  
17) Do you often feel shy?  
18) Do you often feel surrounded by people yet still lack companionship?  
19) Do you often feel there is someone to talk to?  
20) Do you often feel there is someone worth trusting?

> **Key Point:** Traditional metrics capture **only part** of loneliness. The author defines loneliness as both an **inner state** and a **condition of existence**—personal, social, economic, and political. It is not only the yearning for love and friendship or grief when friends are lost; it also includes our **disconnection from politics and work**, our failure to share in social progress, and our sense of **powerlessness, invisibility, and voicelessness**. In short, loneliness is also the feeling of being **out of joint with one’s times**.

Many sense that society is lively and “progressing,” yet the benefits bypass them. They feel **systemically sidelined**. The fundamental cause, the book argues, is the neglect—even the **erosion—of society’s basic infrastructure**, especially under **neoliberalism**.

## Neoliberalism and the Architecture of Isolation
In the 1980s, **Thatcher** and **Reagan** championed neoliberalism. High growth followed, but so did **widening inequality** and **deepening social rifts**. The “Matthew effect” magnified the advantages of the already advantaged; early laggards fell further behind. Successive leaders—**Blair, Clinton, Schröder**, among others—continued market-oriented policies: more competition, higher efficiency, minimal state intervention. The outcome: faster growth for some, **fragmentation** and **distance** for many.

“Greed is good,” the line from *Wall Street*, epitomizes the ethos; technology change accelerated the pattern. The book then moves through consequences—from health to politics.

### Physiological Toll
When you undertake something important alone, your body gears up—short-term vigilance is adaptive. But **chronic solitude** produces **chronic hyper-arousal**: stress hormones remain elevated; the immune system weakens.

- Coronary heart disease risk: **+29%**  
- Stroke risk: **+32%**  
- Clinical dementia risk: **+64%**  
- All-cause early mortality: **~+30%**

Lonely individuals fatigue easily; their bodies show **persistent inflammation**—a risk nexus for atherosclerosis, heart disease, stroke, depression, arthritis, Alzheimer’s, and cancer. Mechanisms include **impaired NK cell activity** and **sustained high norepinephrine**.

### Social Experiments and Community Counterexamples
- **Haredi communities in Israel**: despite high-sugar, high-fat diets and low exercise, they exhibit notable longevity—illustrating that **tight social bonds** can offset lifestyle risks (a suggestive case, not universal proof).
- **Roseto, Pennsylvania**: men 65+ once died at **half** the national rate. Cohesion—Italian kinship patterns, proximity to “mama’s kitchen,” dense neighborly ties—seemed protective.

### The “Retreat” Phenomenon and Declining Empathy
Lab studies with mice show that after four weeks of isolation, a mouse **attacks** a newcomer rather than rejoicing in company. Among humans, prolonged isolation fosters **social withdrawal**—the more lonely one feels, the less one goes out, the more conservative one’s behaviors become. **Empathy declines**, and with it come **hateful speech, extremism**, and **populism**.

---

## Loneliness and the Politics of Extremes
**Hannah Arendt** asked why ordinary people commit extraordinary evil. Her answer, in part, was **“banality”**—but beneath it lay **loneliness**. Those who feel they “belong nowhere” may surrender the self to an ideology that promises **uniformity, belonging, and purpose**. For Arendt, totalitarianism is **built upon loneliness**, which prepares both **executioners and victims**.

This lens clarifies recent politics. **Trump rallies** functioned as mass rituals of belonging—red caps, synchronized slogans (“Make America Great Again”). In France, the **National Rally**; in the Netherlands, the **Party for Freedom**—across contexts, populism surged as more people felt **left behind**.

Populist strategy **leverages lost status and bruised self-esteem**. Many core supporters were **displaced white workers**: once railroad employees, now on benefits. Whether or not Trump materially helps them, he **listened**—or appeared to. He sold **emotional validation** to the lonely.

## City Life: Crowds Without Community
In megacities, many live alone and **do not know their neighbors**. As urban scale expands, manners coarsen; anonymity enables abruptness. Earbuds become **portable walls**—a signal: “Do not talk to me.” The richer the city, the faster the gait; speed compresses the **time available for micro-interactions**.

**Micro-sociality matters.** One café replaced “You’re welcome” with “It’s my pleasure.” That minor linguistic warmth made customers feel tangibly better. Front-line workers who chat a little more **reduce others’ loneliness**.

Why don’t tenants befriend neighbors? **Rent hikes and frequent moves**. If either party will soon relocate, investing in ties seems pointless. In London, the next 20 years are projected to bring a **30% rise in one-person households**. The biggest risk for solo living appears when one **falls ill**.

Why are “mukbangs” popular, especially in Korea? Because dining alongside a streamer simulates **companionship**. Yet extended mediation by screens erodes **civic competence**: we grow less practiced at dialogue, more prone to harsh tones.

### Zero-Contact Design and “Hostile Architecture”
Retail and leisure increasingly valorize **frictionless solitude**: Amazon Go, blind-box vending, one-person karaoke pods. Pandemic-era elders now buy everything online; delivery is **door-drop, faceless**.

Cities deploy **“mosquito devices”**—emitters in frequencies inaudible to the elderly but irritating to youth—to **exclude** teenagers from plazas. **Face recognition gates** rigidify boundaries; safety is pursued without balancing **fairness and friendship**. The cumulative result: finer and finer **segmentation of people**.

A counter-trend comes from the UK’s **“Happy to Chat” benches**—explicit invitations to small talk in a reserved culture. Label the bench, and consent for conversation appears.

## Screens: From Kaleidoscope to Total Capture
In the early 1800s, Sir **David Brewster** invented the **kaleidoscope**. For a while, society feared universal addiction to private, pattern-gazing tubes; people even bumped into walls. The fad faded.

Smartphones did not. A commonly cited figure is **221 phone checks per day**, about **3 hours 15 minutes** daily—likely conservative. **One-third of the world** checks the phone within **five minutes of waking**.

“Face-to-face infidelity” describes a couple sitting together while **each courts a separate screen**. Many watch videos while eating; some scroll while riding e-bikes—dangerously.

**Empathy declines** when interaction moves to screens. In person, we **unconsciously mirror** expressions, building rapport. Video calls blunt that synchrony; **email** is worse—“a petri dish of misunderstanding.” Neutral lines are read as hostile; imagination fills the emotional void.

Why so addictive? Like a **slot machine**, social apps deliver **intermittent reinforcement**: most posts get 10 likes, occasionally 500—jackpot.

There is also **BOMP**—the belief **Others are More Popular**. Social feeds showcase curated peaks, leading viewers to **down-rate their own lives**. For adolescents, public metrics of inclusion/exclusion magnify pressure. Avatars and virtual selves proliferate. Quitting or cutting back is possible—but difficult by design.

## Work, Open Offices, and the Digital Lash
Globally, **40%** of office workers feel lonely at work; in the UK, **60%** do. Paradoxically, the **open-plan office**—without partitions—**increases** loneliness. Noise rises, privacy falls, interruptions mount; employees respond with **headphones**, a literal “do not disturb” sign. **Hot-desking** is worse: if one has no stable place for a family photo or a small plant, one has **no territory**.

Beyond layout, **digitalization** saturates time: enter systems, process emails, sign online, “quick check at midnight.” Off-hours shrink; **work invades all hours**.

What can firms do? **Encourage kindness and communal rituals.** Replace boxed lunches with **shared pots**—“we ate from one pot” forges belonging. **Lengthen lunch** to allow walking and chat. Offer snacks before meetings to **prime goodwill**. Provide **paid care days** for elders or school events. Some firms trial **Fridays off**—four-day weeks that restore energy.

At the other extreme stands the **“digital lash.”** Delivery riders sprint not from poor manners but because **algorithms monitor every second**. Cameras plus AI create a **panopticon**; ratings and stars grade every task. Gig workers—because they are not “employees”—are tightly managed by **code**, not people. CEOs may think this raises efficiency, yet overreach invites **backfire** through burnout and backlash.

### Robots and the Human Future
Service robots now bring items to hotel rooms. In US manufacturing, one robot replaces **3.3 workers** on average, a number likely to rise. White-collar jobs—news, law, accounting, finance—are also vulnerable, as computation outruns human routine.

What should people learn? Less about easily automated routines; more **humanistic** capacities—literature, arts, athletics, play—or become the small elite who **design and direct** the systems. Policy-wise, societies must consider **robot taxation** to fund those displaced.

Humans also **bond with machines**. US soldiers have held funerals for bomb-disposal robots—**real grief** for nonhuman comrades. In Japan, **Shinto animism** (“all things have spirit”) eases attachment to robots like **Paro, Aibo, PaPeRo**, especially among the elderly. Will **care robots**—offering water, stories, massage, comfort—be part of loneliness solutions? The author argues: possibly.

## The Emerging Loneliness Economy
Against this backdrop, certain offline experiences boom. **Concerts** worldwide sell out—big stars and small—because loneliness drives a desire to **gather and go wild together**. **Group fitness** surges; **board games** proliferate; Korea’s **senior ballrooms** mirror China’s **public square dancing**. Clubs, communities, and bookstores re-emerge as **third places**.

To nurture such places, policy matters. Where storefronts sit empty, some cities levy **vacancy taxes** to push landlords to **lower rents** and revive street life. Offline businesses need **rent relief, tax reductions, and subsidies** to counterbalance online convenience.

Bookstores can curate **community reads**: pick a title, invite the neighborhood to discuss it on Saturdays; build **learning ambience** and **cultural exchange**. **Coworking** and **co-living** models can likewise foster **face-to-face** ties.

> “A sense of belonging cannot be bought; it must be practiced.”

You cannot purchase an **experience** the way you buy a service—you must **live it**.

## Conclusion: Choosing Connection in a Lonely Century
We should **reinvest care** in those around us: nation, community, workplace, family, person. Speed should not come at the cost of **deepening isolation**. Companies should serve **employees as well as shareholders**; only when people feel **seen and heard** will loneliness recede. Listen to stories. Build **diverse communities**.

The book ends with **Rwanda’s** example of hope. After genocide, the capital **Kigali** is vibrant. Yet on the **last Saturday of each month**, streets fall quiet except for checkpoints. Police will ask why you are not fulfilling **Umuganda**—“coming together for a common purpose.” Since 1998, communities donate **three hours** to projects—building schools (over **3,000 classrooms**), gardening, trimming hedges, trash pickup, filling potholes. Since 2007, the estimated **economic value** is about **$60 million**—but the **social value** is deeper. Neighbors finally **see one another**; after labor, a **one-hour community meeting** deliberates local issues. Survivors and perpetrators may sit in the same circle; **hatred can be transformed** through **shared work and shared voice**.

The future is, therefore, **in our hands**. Participate offline, pause, talk, care, console. See each concrete person as worthy of attention and love. Only together can we walk through this lonely century.

## Digital Domination and the “Whip of the Algorithm”

In the contemporary workplace, **digitalization never sleeps**. Employees must log into systems, process emails, sign documents, and respond to late-night messages. Work bleeds into evenings and weekends, eroding any true boundary between labor and rest.  

Some corporations have learned that **kindness is strategic**:  
- Serving food “from one pot” at lunch fosters a sense of shared community.  
- Longer lunch breaks allow casual conversation and restore energy.  
- Offering snacks before meetings or providing **paid care days**—for tending to elderly parents or attending children’s school events—signals respect for employees’ private lives.  
- A few firms experiment with **four-day workweeks**, granting every Friday off. Workers return more focused and loyal.

At the opposite extreme lies what Hertz calls the **“digital lash.”** Delivery riders, for example, are not rude; they are racing against an invisible clock. Cameras and artificial intelligence track every movement, and every order is scored within seconds. Gig-economy platforms, because they rarely employ workers directly, rely on **relentless algorithmic management**—ratings, stars, automatic penalties. CEOs may think this ensures efficiency, but it breeds burnout and resentment.

## Robots and Human Affection

Robotics is accelerating beyond factory floors. A single manufacturing robot can now replace an average of **3.3 human workers**, and white-collar occupations—journalism, accounting, even law—face similar risks as artificial intelligence surpasses routine calculation.  

What skills, then, should people pursue? Hertz suggests less focus on easily automated tasks such as basic accounting or machine operation, and more on **humanistic disciplines**—literature, art, music, athletics—that highlight creativity and empathy, or on the rarefied expertise needed to design and control the machines themselves. She also proposes a **“robot tax”** to fund those displaced by automation.

Humans, paradoxically, can form **deep bonds with machines**. U.S. soldiers have held funerals for bomb-disposal robots destroyed in action, grieving as if for fallen comrades. In Japan, **Shinto beliefs**—that all objects have spirit—ease acceptance of robotic companions like **Paro**, **Aibo**, or **PaPeRo**, which many elders treat almost as family members. Hertz argues that **care robots** might one day provide comfort, conversation, even gentle massages to the ill or the lonely.

## The Rise of the “Loneliness Economy”

Despite its dangers, loneliness also creates demand. Around the globe, **live concerts sell out** at unprecedented rates, because people long to gather and feel a shared pulse. **Group fitness classes** and **board-game cafés** flourish. In Korea, **senior dance halls** serve the same social function as China’s public square dancing. Book clubs and neighborhood reading groups reappear as “third spaces,” where strangers can meet and form ties.

Policies can strengthen these connections. Some cities impose **vacancy taxes** on landlords to force empty retail spaces back into use, lowering rents and encouraging small businesses that nurture street life. Governments may subsidize community bookstores, cafés, and restaurants, recognizing that **belonging cannot be bought** but must be **lived and practiced**.  

A bookstore, for instance, might organize a **“community read”**: neighbors agree to read the same book and meet weekly to discuss it, fostering dialogue and cultural exchange. Coworking and co-living arrangements can likewise increase **face-to-face interaction**, countering the isolating pull of online convenience.

> “A sense of belonging,” Hertz insists, “**cannot be purchased; it must be practiced**.”

## Lessons from Rwanda: Collective Action as Antidote

The book closes with a striking case study. After the 1994 genocide, **Rwanda** instituted a monthly nationwide activity called **Umuganda**, meaning “coming together for a common purpose.” On the last Saturday of each month, the normally bustling capital of **Kigali** falls silent except for police checkpoints. Every citizen contributes **three hours of community labor**: building schools, cleaning gardens, filling potholes.  

Since 2007, Umuganda has created an estimated **60 million dollars** in economic value, but its greater achievement is **social healing**. Neighbors—sometimes including both genocide survivors and former perpetrators—work side by side, then hold an **hour-long community meeting** to deliberate local issues. Shared labor and dialogue have **repaired social fabric once thought irreparably torn**.

---

## Final Reflection: Choosing Connection

Hertz’s message is ultimately hopeful. The future of loneliness is not predetermined; **it is in our hands**. We must:  

- **Participate offline**—walk, meet, and converse face-to-face.  
- **Care for the nearby**—family, neighbors, co-workers—rather than only distant online acquaintances.  
- **Build diverse communities** that listen to every voice and treat each member as visible and valuable.

Cities and companies must also act: not merely serving shareholders but fostering environments where **employees and residents feel heard and seen**.  

Only through such deliberate, collective effort can we navigate—and soften—the challenges of **The Lonely Century**.
