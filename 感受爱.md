Today we are at the Fan Deng Bookstore in Xiamen to record the discussion of this book, *Feeling Love*.  
Why did I choose this new book? Because the author’s story deeply moved me.  

She is a psychologist, and during the development of psychology there was a peak era in the 1980s focused on medication. At that time, people leaned heavily on studying the effects of drugs on psychological treatment—believing that taking certain pills could quickly lift one’s mood. As psychiatric drugs advanced, more and more papers were written on medication, and many psychologists even switched careers, feeling there was little left to explore; people could simply take medicine without therapy.

Both Dr. Segal and her husband were psychologists. But in 1996, their own child, who suffered from depression, died by suicide. She explained that they had trusted medication too much and gave their child many psychiatric drugs, yet no amount of medicine could save their child’s life. The child’s death by jumping left the young parents in immense pain, waking each morning haunted by memories of that dark time.  

One day, Dr. Segal told herself: *If the rest of my life must be accompanied by this feeling, then let it be.* This acceptance allowed her to coexist with the pain instead of resisting it. She then picked up her psychological research again, no longer relying so completely on medicine, and began to think about how communication and connection could help patients heal. Together, they created a nonprofit website called HelpGuide.org to share all their psychological assistance methods for free.

**What is this book about?** 
Most books teach us how to care for others and how to love others. But this one tackles a topic we seldom explore: **how to feel loved**.  

The author explains that everyone in her family loved their daughter deeply—there was no doubt. They accompanied her and made many sacrifices. As a psychologist herself, she believed they had done everything right as parents. Yet the child could not feel loved and fell into loneliness.  

So Dr. Segal dedicated the rest of her life to studying a critical question: **How can a person truly feel love?**  

Many of us have met people whose hearts you simply cannot warm, no matter how hard you try. They constantly feel wronged, mistreated, or unappreciated. Why does this happen? How can it be resolved? Could we ourselves be people who cannot feel love, and therefore feel unhappy?

**An Opening Case**
There was a girl named Monica, one of the author’s patients, who suffered from severe kidney disease and also had a troubled relationship with her boyfriend. Her emotional life was clearly affecting her health.  

One day the hospital called: Monica was in critical condition. Dr. Segal rushed over, only to find Monica excitedly sitting up in bed. Monica told her to close the door—she had news. Monica announced that she had broken up with her boyfriend and had met a man who truly loved her.  

Despite her critical illness, she was now passionately in love, planning to marry and travel. To the author’s surprise, Monica’s health improved dramatically. Months later she was well enough to travel, and even during occasional relapses her new partner stayed by her side with deep care.  

The conclusion was clear: Monica’s physical recovery and “miracle” turnaround were strongly connected to the intense love she felt. Her previous poor health was closely tied to the lack of emotional connection in her life.

We now come to the core theme of the book: What is love, and how do we feel it?

Every day we are governed by two fundamental feelings: love and fear. One always dominates. If you are not living in love today, you are very likely living in fear.

For example: at work, you can choose to act with love—experiencing joy, dedication, and happiness. Or you can choose fear—thinking about KPIs, fines, or the shame of failing. These two modes shape our lives.

⸻

How do we distinguish between love and fear?

When fear rules us, the body releases adrenaline. This creates three typical responses:
	•	Fight
	•	Flight
	•	Freeze

Just like a rabbit frozen in car headlights: either it attacks, runs, or is paralyzed. Under adrenaline, we feel anger, avoidance, or helplessness.

By contrast, when love rules, our body produces oxytocin. The name may sound like it’s only linked to childbirth, but it’s not. Whenever you feel cared for, warm, and safe, your body releases oxytocin.

Oxytocin has a key function: it neutralizes cortisol, the stress hormone.

Cortisol builds up when we live under long-term stress, leading to illnesses such as cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, heart disease, and liver problems. Even babies produce cortisol: if a newborn grows up in a loveless environment—ignored, scolded, or greeted with cold faces—the baby’s brain development will be suppressed by excess cortisol. Such children may later avoid studying, avoid speaking, and struggle to connect with others.

⸻

What does love feel like?

When love appears, you feel joy, fullness, protection, acceptance, openness, calm, focus, and relaxation.

This is why, the speaker explains, he insists on having an audience while giving book talks. Speaking into a camera with a blank-faced cameraman behind it feels oppressive—fear-based, without love. But when surrounded by attentive, encouraging listeners—even silent ones—their supportive eyes and applause create a sense of being loved. His body then produces oxytocin, and his mood becomes joyful.

⸻

Why do so many people crave love but cannot find it?

The reasons usually fall into three categories:
	1.	Not seeking love. They assume there is nothing to look for.
	2.	Failure to recognize love. They are already surrounded by loving gestures and care, but cannot perceive it.
	3.	The more you chase, the less you feel. For example: when moving to a big city, you may feel insecure. You think: “Once I buy a home, I’ll feel safe.” You work hard to buy the house, but still feel insecure. Then you think: “I’ll feel safe after paying off the mortgage.” Years later, with the debt gone, you still don’t feel secure.

The problem lies in chasing the wrong object. Material things—houses, cars, credit cards, bank savings—cannot provide the sensation of being loved. The more you gain, the less fulfilled you feel.

⸻

How can you know whether you are feeling loved?

Here are some guiding questions:
	•	Does your spouse or partner willingly talk with you, or just turn away and say “Go to sleep”?
	•	If you live alone, is there anyone who comforts you when you are sad, or celebrates with you when you are joyful?
	•	Is there someone you trust, with whom you feel safe?
	•	Do your loved ones really feel your love? Do they know you appreciate their true selves?

If your answers are “no,” then either you—or those you care about—may not be experiencing the feeling of love.

Many listeners weep at this point, because it touches their long-term absence of love.

The neuroscience of love

Our ability to feel love is profoundly shaped by early life experiences.

At birth, a baby’s brain cell connections are chaotic, without order. Throughout life, these connections change continuously—until death. But the richness and pattern of connections depend on the baby’s relationship with caregivers.

If the mother or caregiver provides secure, loving attention, the brain’s networks form stronger, healthier patterns. If neglected or mistreated, the brain develops differently, shaping a person’s lifelong capacity to feel love.

This insight aligns with the book Parent’s Language, which shows how early communication dramatically impacts a child’s brain.

Positive psychology also confirms: happiness comes from pleasant interactions with others—not houses, cars, or money. Genuine joy arises from good relationships.

⸻

The desire for companionship

Take the idea of “traveling alone.” Many dream of spontaneous solo trips. But those who travel alone often end up seeking company—chatting with strangers, making friends, or wishing loved ones were with them.

The truth: journeys shared with companions are more joyful than journeys alone. Even frequent solo travelers often long to share the experience with someone.

This underscores a basic human truth: happiness comes from connection.

### How to Increase Oxytocin and Feel More Love

Everyone, regardless of gender, hopes to release enough oxytocin to feel love and happiness.  
The author highlights **three main ways** to boost oxytocin:

1. **Face-to-face connection in the present moment**  
   Oxytocin release happens in real time, during in-person encounters.  
   Cherish opportunities for direct interaction.  
   Text messages or online chats cannot fully create this chemical reaction.  
   Many people chase excitement online—streaming, gaming, live chats—but those bring only thrills, not true love.  
   That is why so many online romances fall apart when the couple finally meets: there is no oxytocin spark.

2. **You can only give love if you have felt it yourself**  
   If you rarely feel loved, it’s hard to share love with others.  
   People with abundant love have a magnetic presence; they naturally draw others in because they have love to share.

3. **It is never too late to experience love**  
   Age is no barrier.  
   The author recounts a couple who fell in love and married at seventy.  
   Their children opposed the marriage, but the couple felt genuine, youthful passion and daily joy—proving that love can blossom at any stage of life.

### Examples of Love’s Transformative Power

- **The Classroom Miracle**  
  A U.S. teacher took over the worst class in a school.  
  Without special training or complicated methods, she simply looked into each child’s eyes, listened patiently, and showed sincere understanding and care.  
  As students sensed authentic love, their behavior and grades improved dramatically.  
  This mirrors the Indian film *Hichki* (“Hiccup Teacher”), where love—not force—changes lives.

- **Personal Memories**  
  The speaker recalls his mother, a teacher, knitting gloves for a student whose hands were covered in frostbite.  
  The child, who had lost her parents, never forgot that act of love and remained close to his mother for life.  
  Such small, heartfelt gestures have lasting impact.

### Key Facts About Oxytocin

Oxytocin is often called the *bonding* or *love* hormone.  
It counteracts stress hormones like cortisol and influences many social and emotional behaviors.  
It strengthens connections not only between parent and child but also with friends, partners, and even pets.

Nonverbal signals—like hugs, kisses, holding hands, eye contact, or simply a warm smile—can trigger oxytocin.  
Even a few-week-old infant responds to eye contact and mirroring gestures, thanks to mirror neurons in the brain.

Throughout life, feeling loved enhances happiness and joy by boosting oxytocin.

---

### Why We Fail to Feel Love

A crucial insight of the book is that we must distinguish **emotion** from **stress**.  
People often confuse the two.

When someone is angry, we might tell them to “control your emotions.”  
But suppressing one emotion dulls *all* emotions, including joy.  
Antidepressants can numb feelings in the same way: a friend of the speaker became calm after medication but also lost excitement and humor.

This numbness—called *麻木不仁* in Chinese, literally “numb and unfeeling”—blocks the ability to sense love.  
Children from damaged families sometimes cut themselves, not necessarily out of a desire to die, but to *feel* something when their hearts are otherwise numb.

---

### Emotions Are a Mixture

Emotions never appear singly; they are blends.  
Consider a parent waiting anxiously for a child who is late: fear, anger, relief, love—all mix together.  
We cannot isolate just the “love” while removing the “worry.”

Therefore, we mustn’t fear emotions.  
Every feeling carries a message—anger can motivate improvement, sadness can prompt reflection or connection.  
Instead of silencing emotions, listen to what they are telling you.

The real disruptor is **stress**, not emotion itself.  
Stress pushes us to avoid emotions, to numb ourselves, or to lash out.  
Understanding this difference is essential to regaining sensitivity to love.

---

### Modern Obstacles to Love

The author identifies three major barriers:

1. **Over-reliance on medication**  
   Drugs may be necessary in acute crises, but long-term dependence turns people into “walking dead,” detached from both giving and receiving love.

2. **Virtual connections**  
   Hours spent online can provide information and fleeting excitement, but not the deep satisfaction that comes from in-person interaction and oxytocin release.

3. **Overthinking and the illusion of certainty**  
   Constant worry and the desire for everything to be predictable trap us in our heads.  
   True vitality comes from embracing *uncertainty*—a core wisdom of Daoist philosophy.  
   Life’s beauty lies in its unpredictability.

The author cites the parable of “Buridan’s Donkey”: a donkey starved because it could not choose between equal options of food and water.  
Sometimes you must simply move, accept uncertainty, and live.

### Practical Methods to Relieve Stress and Awaken the Sense of Love

To cultivate the ability to feel love, the most critical step is **managing stress**.  
Only when you can handle intense pressure will you notice the subtle rise and fall of emotions and sense the delicate signals of love.

#### 1. The “Stable E-Zone”

The author introduces the idea of a **“Stable E-Zone”**—the ideal range of stress.  
- **Too much stress** leads to overreaction, anxiety, and burnout.  
- **Too little stress** leads to underreaction and emotional numbness; even acts of kindness may not register.

The right amount of stress creates *flow*—a state of engagement and enjoyment where we can interact meaningfully with others and experience love.

Excessive long-term stress triggers feelings of helplessness and hopelessness, wounding the spirit.  
This explains why many entrepreneurs feel euphoric in the early, high-pressure start-up phase but later struggle with depression or turn to spiritual practices for relief: prolonged cortisol overload eventually harms the psyche.

Many people try to relieve stress in unhealthy ways, such as by **blaming others**. Sudden outbursts or constant fault-finding are often misguided attempts to lower internal pressure.

---

#### 2. Two Quick, Reliable Stress-Relief Techniques

The author shares two simple yet powerful methods anyone can learn:

- **(a) Confide in a trusted person.**  
  Face-to-face conversation with someone you trust can quickly reduce stress.

- **(b) Use your senses to “bring yourself back.”**  
  Engage sight, sound, smell, taste, or touch to anchor yourself in the present moment.  
  For example:
  - Focus on the texture and temperature of a cup in your hand.
  - Watch reeds sway in the wind and notice their movement.
  - Breathe in the aroma of wine and identify its earthy or floral notes.

Such mindful attention quiets the mind and lowers stress hormones.

The key is self-awareness: notice when you enter a fight, flight, or freeze state, and then consciously use sensory grounding or trusted conversation to return to calm.

---

#### 3. Meditation: “Taming the Wild Horse”

For deeper practice, the book offers a meditation technique called **“Taming the Wild Horse.”**  
Our thoughts often gallop wildly like an untamed horse.  
This method helps you regain focus and mindfulness—even while active.

Unlike traditional seated meditation, you can practice it while working, walking, or even speaking.  
The book’s appendix includes a complete guided routine: how to sit or move, relax the head, neck, and shoulders, and gradually enter a state of mindful awareness.

---

#### 4. The Power of Reflection

After any meaningful activity, take time to reflect.  
Reflection deepens satisfaction and creates lasting memories of love and fulfillment.

For instance, after attending a lecture or sharing a special moment, pause to savor the experience rather than rushing to the next task.  
This conscious revisiting of feelings imprints joy and connection more strongly.

This is why first love remains so precious: we repeatedly revisit it in memory, drawing long-lasting emotional nourishment.

---

### Love as an Active Verb

The author emphasizes that love is not merely a state—it is a **verb**, an action.  
When you actively care for others, even if love isn’t present at first, it can grow through your actions.

Examples:
- A selfish man marries a wealthy woman for money, but through caring for her, he gradually falls in love and experiences fulfillment.  
- In the film *A World Without Thieves*, Andy Lau’s cold-hearted thief risks his life to protect a naïve traveler, ultimately discovering deep satisfaction and love.

**Lesson:** If you want to feel love, practice loving actions. Love grows through doing.

### Tools for Quick Emotional Reset

Create personal triggers—music, scents, or images—that help you relax instantly.  
For example, keep a favorite photo or video that always soothes you.  
Develop the habit now, so when stress arises you can quickly tap these calming cues.

When sharing feelings with a trusted friend, remember: **speak without explaining or justifying.**  
Simply state your feelings—“I feel sad,” “I feel nauseous,” “I can’t sleep.”  
Pure expression releases pressure more effectively than debate or analysis.

### The “Feeling Loved” Formula: **AACCCRR**

The author summarizes the entire approach in one memorable formula:

- **A A – Awareness & Assessment**  
  - First, assess yourself: Are you in fight, flight, or freeze?  
  - Then assess others: What state are they in?

- **C C – Communication & Connection**  
  - Communicate through conversation, hugs, eye contact, holding hands—any genuine link.

- **R R – Reshaping & Response**  
  - Reshape your inner state as you become more emotionally attuned.  
  - Respond to others’ actions with thoughtful reflection and appreciation.

### Real-Life Applications of AACCCRR

**At Work:**  
Jillian, a young professional, once rushed to her office wearing a tennis outfit after an urgent call to find a missing file.  
Her boss criticized her attire as unprofessional.  
Initially hurt and angry, Jillian later used the AACCCRR steps: she calmly explained her feelings and the context to her boss.  
The boss, recognizing her own stress, apologized.  
Their relationship improved instead of souring.

**In Marriage:**  
A wife who valued solitary time felt torn when her husband wanted constant closeness.  
Applying AACCCRR, she created a warm setting and spoke from the heart:  
“I love you. Do you truly feel my love? When I don’t stop what I’m doing as soon as you get home, do you feel disappointed?”  
Her husband admitted he sometimes did.  
Through honest sharing of feelings and needs, they deepened mutual understanding and affection.

---

### Love Beyond Memory

One of the most touching stories is of a husband caring for his wife with Alzheimer’s disease.  
Though she became forgetful and irritable, he researched how to reach her senses:  
- Playing her favorite music  
- Decorating their home with the yellow flowers she loved  
- Using touch, gentle sounds, and scents to communicate  

Even as her memory faded, these sensory connections let them continue to share love.

---

### Final Insights

- **You don’t need to change material conditions to be happier.**  
  We often chase the wrong things—houses, money—believing they bring love and security.  
  In truth, love and happiness come from connection, not possessions.

- **When we feel unloved, our tempers worsen.**  
  Recognize the fight/flight/freeze pattern and address the need for love rather than suppressing emotions.

- **Offer care to others.**  
  The more you give love, the more love you feel in return.

The author ends with a parable:  
A man, chased by a tiger, hangs from a vine over a deadly cliff.  
Above waits the tiger; below is the abyss.  
Beside him grows a single wild strawberry.  
He reaches out, plucks it, and savors its sweetness.  
That strawberry represents life’s true essence: even when danger surrounds us, there is always a small, beautiful moment to taste and cherish.

---

**Conclusion**

*Feeling Love* teaches that love is an ability, not a fixed state.  
By managing stress, embracing uncertainty, and practicing active, present-moment connection, anyone—at any age—can learn to **feel love** and share it with others.
