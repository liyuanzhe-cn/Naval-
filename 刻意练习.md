# 刻意练习 **Deliberate Practice**

**Recommendation**  
Since childhood, we’ve been inundated by countless stories of geniuses: Newton, Einstein, Gauss, Da Vinci, Mozart, Madame Curie… all seemingly born with extraordinary talent and unmatched diligence. We envy them, yet feel ashamed. We tell ourselves we lack their gifts, while parents insist we simply don’t work hard enough—especially after hearing the trendy “10,000-hour rule,” which makes children forever bear the label of not working hard.  

This book clears that misunderstanding. The author reveals that greatness is not an inborn gift but a skill anyone can learn. The key to becoming exceptional lies in *deliberate practice*. Success requires effort, but true achievement—the path to genius—comes not from mere hard work, but from purposeful, structured practice. Let’s explore what deliberate practice really is.

**You Will Learn**  
- The concept and characteristics of deliberate practice  
- How to apply its principles  
- How to view natural ability and talent correctly  

**About the Author**  
Dr. Anders Ericsson, a psychology professor at Florida State University and a Conradi Eminent Scholar, pioneered the “deliberate practice” framework. He devoted his career to studying how top performers in sports, music, chess, medicine, and the military achieve exceptional results, and the role deliberate practice plays.

Today’s book can truly help you become a genius. Many children fall asleep listening to my talks, so to all the kids: if you genuinely want to be a genius, follow the principles in this book and you can.  
And for adults? The same applies—you can still become outstanding in any field by using the methods in *Deliberate Practice*.

Many think genius is innate. Take Mozart, for example: composing at four, performing globally at six, gifted with “perfect pitch,” able to hear a note and name it precisely. Yet this book shatters the myth: Mozart was not born with perfect pitch. His father, a composer, dedicated himself full-time to cultivating young Mozart, applying experience gained from training Mozart’s older siblings. That intensive, early environment—*not* magic genes—produced the prodigy.

Consider Paganini, famed for playing a violin piece to the end even after three strings snapped, bleeding from his fingers as he finished on a single string. People hailed him as a natural genius. In reality, he had deliberately practiced this stunt. He once composed a duet piece removing two strings to woo a lady, then experimented with one-string compositions. In that famous concert he intentionally tightened strings to break them one by one, executing a feat he had mastered long before.

Every “genius,” when examined closely, shares the same hidden secret: *deliberate practice*—a systematic method for pushing beyond limits.

Yet some point to Malcolm Gladwell’s *Outliers* and its famous “10,000-hour rule,” which suggests that simply putting in 10,000 hours guarantees mastery. Ericsson, whose research Gladwell referenced, disagrees. Gladwell’s simplified pop-science version became a bestseller precisely because it was easy to digest, but it misleads.

Think about it: a security guard who’s spent tens of thousands of hours watching a gate—has he become a master guard? A disengaged teacher with decades of classroom time—has she become extraordinary? Not necessarily. Some skills require far less than 10,000 hours for a breakthrough; others demand more. And without focused effort, even 10,000 hours is wasted.

Take one of Ericsson’s classic experiments from the 1980s–90s. He recruited a college student to practice remembering strings of random numbers—like the show *The Brain* where contestants recall long digit sequences. Most people can hold about seven digits, maybe a phone number’s eleven if they’re good. This student initially plateaued at eight digits. Training one hour per week, finding new strategies to stretch his limit, after about two years—roughly a hundred sessions—he could recall 82 random digits in sequence. An ordinary person became “super-memory” material through structured, deliberate training. Later, others adopted the same method and pushed further: a Chinese teenager eventually memorized over 300 digits read aloud once. No innate gift—just methodical, targeted practice.

Human limits keep breaking. In 1908, marathon champion Johnny Hayes set a world record of 2:55:18. Today, to even qualify for the Boston Marathon, men aged 18–34 must run under 3:05, and the world record is 2:02:57—nearly an hour faster. Early divers once called a double somersault into water impossible; now elite divers perform far more complex routines. Memory feats too: in 1973, Richard Spencer recited π to 511 decimal places. Later, David Shakle recited 10,000; an Indian named Mina recited 70,000; and a Japanese man, Akira Haraguchi, claimed 100,000.

Physical feats also stretch: someone once did 10,507 push-ups in a single go; in 1993 a man completed 46,001 push-ups in 21 hours. Such records prove both body and brain continually adapt.

Our brains are extraordinarily malleable. Consider London’s black-cab drivers, who must master the city’s maze of streets without relying on GPS. Earning a license requires memorizing countless intricate routes. Brain scans show that these cabbies have a significantly enlarged posterior hippocampus compared to bus drivers or average people—clear evidence that intensive training reshapes the brain itself.

So what exactly is deliberate practice? It differs sharply from casual repetition:

1. **Clear, measurable goals.** Tasks must have specific, objective targets. That’s why activities like diving, chess, memory competitions, or push-ups suit deliberate practice—they’re quantifiable.  
2. **Deep focus.** Benjamin Franklin loved chess and played thousands of hours, yet never reached top rank. Why? He treated it as leisure, not structured improvement. He didn’t hire stronger opponents or analyze games carefully.  

But in writing, Franklin *did* use deliberate practice. Lacking formal schooling, he read essays he admired, set them aside, rewrote them from memory, then compared his version to the original to find gaps and errors—setting goals, practicing, getting feedback, and revising.

Similarly, Gladwell cited The Beatles’ countless live performances as the source of their genius. Ericsson counters: mere hours on stage didn’t raise their technical level; if anything, fatigue sometimes lowered it. Their true deliberate practice was songwriting—endless hours perfecting melodies and lyrics.

Another key is to **push beyond your comfort zone**. Each session should be slightly harder than the last and include feedback for continuous refinement. Even weight-loss advice like weighing yourself daily exemplifies this: measurement provides feedback for adjustment.

**(Continuation of the English translation of *Deliberate Practice* book interpretation)**  

Another crucial concept is **mental representations**. This technical term refers to the brain’s internal, almost subconscious models of a skill or situation.  

For example, when you see a dog, you don’t analyze “species characteristics” or tail length—you instantly think “dog.” That rapid recognition is a mental representation. A better analogy is touch-typing: if someone asks you to picture exactly where the letters A or N are on the keyboard, you might hesitate. But when you actually type, your fingers fly without conscious thought.  

Sports demonstrate this beautifully. In one legendary Argentine World Cup match, players completed seventeen consecutive passes before scoring, barely seeming to think. Their moves weren’t deliberate decisions; they were the product of thousands of training hours that built automatic, lightning-fast mental maps of the field. That’s why professional commentators “see” plays far ahead of casual fans: their mental representations are rich and complete, while amateurs just notice handsome players or flashy moves.

Consider chess masters who play multiple simultaneous blindfold games. They can recall every piece on more than a hundred boards without looking. It’s not photographic memory. When researchers asked these masters to memorize random, nonsensical piece placements, their recall was no better than an average person’s. Their brilliance comes from years of practice that encoded typical chess patterns so deeply that each new configuration instantly triggers an internal model of the game’s flow.

Training’s real goal, then, is to build such mental representations—intuitive, automatic responses. Divers executing complex flips don’t recite instructions midair; their minds already contain a detailed, embodied simulation of each muscle’s motion.  

I reflected on my own skills and realized that my ability to break down and present a book’s logic likely stems from mental representations built through weekly book talks. Over time I’ve practiced mapping a text’s structure quickly and clearly—exactly the effect of deliberate practice.

Driving shows a similar progression. Beginners consciously recite every step, but experienced drivers “just drive,” guided by automatic mental models. The essence of practice is forging these well-honed subconscious responses.

How are such mental representations formed? The author studied German violin students, grouping them as *good*, *very good*, and *elite*. Violin is among the hardest instruments: no frets, no markings, everything guided by feel. He tracked their practice histories and found:  

- By age 18, “good” students had averaged about **3,420** hours of deliberate practice.  
- “Very good” students: **5,301** hours.  
- “Elite” students: **7,410** hours.

All had practiced deliberately; none reached professional level without it. The clear difference lay in *total focused hours*.  

The film *Akeelah and the Bee* illustrates the same truth. A young girl with ordinary grades mastered extraordinarily obscure words through intensive coaching and repetition, eventually winning the national spelling bee.  

This pattern echoes but also sharpens Gladwell’s 10,000-hour idea: the key is not a magic number but focused quality. Some arts, like ballet, may demand 10,000 hours before age twenty to reach mastery; other skills might require far fewer.

Ericsson warns the “10,000-hour rule” creates three misconceptions:  
1. **False promises.** You can’t assure success just by logging hours. A real-estate agent bragging about 10,000 hours of sales calls won’t automatically become a legend.  
2. **Intimidation.** People may quit, thinking 10,000 hours is impossible, when a few hundred hours of focused work might create dramatic results—as with the memory student who reached world-class ability in just a couple hundred hours.  
3. **Misplaced faith in effort alone.** Even exceeding 10,000 hours doesn’t guarantee excellence if the practice lacks structure.

That’s the difference between pop bestsellers and rigorous research: catchy but imprecise versus careful and precise.

How can we apply deliberate practice in real life?  
Consider *Top Gun*, the U.S. Navy’s elite pilot school. During the Vietnam War, American pilots were initially losing one jet for every two enemy planes. After adopting Top Gun’s intense training—where expert instructors simulate enemy tactics and push trainees to their limits, meticulously analyzing each dangerous drill—ratios flipped to five enemy planes lost for every American jet.  

Work can be treated the same way. Take creating PowerPoint decks: instead of mindlessly churning slides, aim to become a presentation master—set specific goals for design, storytelling, and delivery. Each presentation is a training session.

The speaker shares his own example: giving weekly talks to audiences of a thousand. At first, nerves and the desire to please drained him. Gradually he set new challenges: stay calm, speak slowly like professional singers who project effortlessly, and still keep the audience engaged. Step by step, he built higher-level skills by treating each talk as structured practice.

Deliberate practice counters three common myths:  
1. **Genetic limits.** Great speakers aren’t born with a “speaking gene.” Many top debaters once struggled with stuttering but conquered it through relentless, targeted drills.  
2. **Time guarantees mastery.** Long hours alone don’t suffice.  
3. **Effort alone is enough.** Working hard without specific feedback and adjustment is not enough.

Ericsson summarizes the process as the **3F principle**:  
- **Focus** – absolute concentration on the task.  
- **Feedback** – continual input from a coach or objective measures.  
- **Fix it** – act immediately to correct weaknesses.

A story illustrates this: a golfer mindlessly hitting balls claimed to be “practicing.” His coach replied, “You’re just playing.” True practice requires analysis and correction. Tiger Woods, even after multiple championships, rebuilt his swing from scratch to improve—classic deliberate practice.

---

Elite athletes show the same mindset. Kobe Bryant spoke of 4 a.m. training sessions, shooting thousands of baskets in lonely, repetitive drills. This is the opposite of casual pick-up games where people laugh and high-five; it’s structured, feedback-driven, and mentally demanding.

Feedback is essential. A 70-year-old man sought a black belt in karate. Rather than attend a generic class, he worked one-on-one with a coach who constantly corrected him and assigned focused homework. By 75 he’d achieved a blue belt and was on track for black by 80.

Similarly, a 36-year-old novice set out to become a professional golfer. He hired experts, devoted himself full-time, and improved rapidly through deliberate practice.

Language learning works the same way: listening to music passively is not enough. You need concrete goals and ideally a skilled tutor for feedback.

The third “F,” **Fix it**, means correcting errors relentlessly. In college table tennis, the narrator once lost badly to professionals until he adopted their method: isolate each weakness—forehand topspin one afternoon, backhand block the next—repeating each movement hundreds of times.  

Olympic examples abound: coach Liu Guoliang feeding balls to Zhang Jike at machine-gun speed; young Fukuhara Ai crying through 1,000 uninterrupted practice hits under her mother’s watchful eye. Painful repetition, immediate correction—that is deliberate practice.

These examples embody the 3F principle: **Focus**, **Feedback**, and **Fix it**.  
- **Focus**: absolute concentration on a well-defined goal.  
- **Feedback**: regular, specific input from a coach, mentor, or objective measure.  
- **Fix it**: immediate correction of weaknesses revealed by feedback.

When you bring this mindset to daily work, every task can become a training ground. Imagine approaching your job each morning with the intention to refine one specific skill—over months and years, that steady improvement compounds.

Deliberate practice applies equally to personal life.  
The first step is to **find a mentor**—someone truly excellent in the field you wish to master. Research their reputation, hear from former students, examine their credentials, and learn directly under their guidance.  

What if you can’t find a mentor? One story in the book describes a circus clown whose job was to entertain the audience between acts, though most people ignored him and went for snacks. Determined to become a master storyteller, he practiced on the streets, stopping strangers to chat and tell jokes. Each interaction, he timed with a stopwatch, tracking how long he could keep someone engaged. Rejection after rejection, he measured every attempt, gradually extending the conversations and perfecting his craft.  

In this case, the stopwatch itself became his “mentor,” providing the necessary **feedback**. When human coaches aren’t available, accurate self-measurement can play the same role.

Many of us set New Year’s goals—learn guitar, start swimming, hit the gym—but stumble when enthusiasm fades. The author notes that second-hand guitar sales soar every spring because beginners quit during the “plateau stage,” the discouraging period after early progress when improvement slows and mastery feels distant.

Crossing this plateau is critical. The key is **sustaining motivation**. We often think successful people have extraordinary willpower, but research shows there’s no universal “willpower trait.” Someone disciplined in one area may lack discipline in another. What really drives perseverance is **motivation**—a mix of internal desire and external support.

Effective strategies to maintain motivation include:

1. **Habit formation.** Writers, for example, commit to a daily writing routine. One famous Chinese screenwriter advised beginners to “shadow-write” movies: watch a film and simultaneously speak out the script in proper format. After dozens of films, you naturally learn scriptwriting structure—sheer habit builds skill.

2. **External support.** Benjamin Franklin formed a club where members met weekly to share new discoveries. Surrounded by curious peers, each participant felt compelled to learn something fresh before every meeting. You can create a similar small club of six to eight people, gathering monthly to discuss personal progress and new insights. Such peer accountability fuels steady growth.

3. **External cues.** Visual reminders help—people trying to lose weight often hang inspirational photos on their walls. Bodybuilders pin pictures of ideal physiques to stay driven.

---

Everyone who climbs from beginner to expert passes through **four stages**:

1. **Interest.** Children rarely fall in love with chess or violin spontaneously. Parents expose them to experiences that spark curiosity.

2. **Seriousness.** After initial fun, they begin to practice with structure and regularity—like a child advancing to a blue-red belt in taekwondo and feeling committed.

3. **Full Commitment.** At this stage, all other pursuits may pause for an all-out push, as debaters or competitive musicians dedicate entire summers to their craft.

4. **Innovation.** Finally, the master begins to create new techniques—like table-tennis legend Liu Guoliang inventing the powerful “reverse penhold backhand.” Innovation signals true expertise.

This brings us back to the fundamental question: *Do geniuses truly exist?*  
Many families seem to produce talent generation after generation. The best explanation is not mystical genetics but environment and culture. Children raised where music, science, or art is valued are more likely to develop interest and motivation, leading to sustained practice.

The author shares an example: a friend whose elder brother became the principal violinist of China’s National Center for the Performing Arts. Their father, a musician, poured intense effort into training the older brother, sometimes even resorting to harsh discipline. By the time the younger sibling learned piano, the father, perhaps gentler, invested less rigor, and the younger child reached only moderate skill.  

This doesn’t advocate harshness but highlights the family culture of focused training as the real driver of exceptional ability.

---

Even supposed “natural gifts” like **perfect pitch**—the ability to identify notes without a reference—are trainable. Once thought rare (perhaps 1 in 10,000 people), studies show that 60–70% of children can develop perfect pitch through early and consistent training. Those of us who “can’t hear the difference” simply haven’t practiced.

What about savant-like abilities in autism, such as extraordinary math or art skills? These too often stem from intense concentration and repetitive engagement. Autistic children can fixate on a subject with a focus most neurotypical people rarely sustain, leading to exceptional proficiency—not divine endowment.

The true meaning of “talent,” then, is **interest plus motivation**, which fuels the long, structured journey of deliberate practice.

---

After finishing this book, the most liberating insight is: **never set artificial limits on yourself.**  
Don’t assume “I’m just not cut out for that,” or “I lack the gift.” When we bring deliberate practice into our work, studies, and daily life, every one of us can grow far beyond what we imagine.

If ordinary people could all memorize hundreds of digits, master chess, perform Olympic dives, or learn martial arts at advanced ages, society as a whole would be transformed. The only barrier is the outdated belief that such feats belong only to a chosen few.

Even intelligence scores show no strict link to genius-level achievement. Nobel Prize–winning scientists average roughly the same IQ as their peers, sometimes slightly lower. Top chess players’ IQs are about average. Their greatness stems from deliberate practice and the dense mental representations it builds.

**Final Inspiration**  
This book, *Deliberate Practice*, offers a stunning message of possibility. Young listeners especially have a head start—time. Begin now, and you can become extraordinary in any field you choose.  

But even for those well into adulthood, the lesson stands: dedicate time to structured, focused, feedback-rich practice, and you *will* achieve qualitative transformation.  

That is the ultimate promise of *Deliberate Practice*:  
genius is not born—it is **made**.
